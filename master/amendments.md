# ðŸ§° Amendments

> "Change is eternal to human and humankind. Sometimes to adapt to change, willingness to change is required from within each and every human being."

_Before we begin, an individual citizen should gain access to the Foundation's Gitbook to initiate change requests to this Open Constitution. This is generally accorded when members join the Foundation. Read_ [_Open Access_](../open-access-charter.md) _levels._

_****Articles of association for each constitutional body is presented on a single page of this Open Constitution. Each page is known as a single **instrument** of the Open Constitution. ****_&#x20;

Each **instrument** is bound by a specific custodian, either a Council or a Committee, which is responsible for upkeep and amendment of the laws, enacted in the Foundation's self governance.
