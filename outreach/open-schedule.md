# ðŸ“» Open Schedule

Open Podcast is where members host knowledge sessions and workshops on different initiatives of the Muellners Foundation. The podcast streams are public facing. Attendees from all spaces of life who find meaning and shared interests, join podcast episodes. &#x20;

Open Podcasts also act as an outreach event for the global citizens of the Foundation.&#x20;

Open Podcast is the platform of "voice" for the community members to present their views publicly.

## **Community is tracking the following LIVE schedule here:**
