# üìΩ Open Podcast

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:green;">**Open Podcast**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">is a community outreach initiative by the Foundation.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">Muellners Foundation promotes and advocates Internet freedom and open engineering ideas in these podcasts.</mark>
{% endhint %}

> <mark style="color:purple;">With Open Podcast, Foundation's global citizens express their views, their case studies and open research in an open session.</mark>
>
> <mark style="color:purple;">a. Members may present their views on subjects which are core</mark> [<mark style="color:purple;">research focus</mark>](broken-reference) <mark style="color:purple;">of the Foundation.</mark>
>
> <mark style="color:purple;">b. Live Streams are broadcast on different forums of the Internet.</mark> \ <mark style="color:purple;">c. All episodes are released in open source, where citizens share their experiential learning for the benefit of humanity, and to advocate Foundation's guiding principles.</mark> &#x20;

## A peer reviewed podcast!

Open podcasts are peer reviewed. This means that for any podcast to be an "Open Podcast":&#x20;

Note: For any Live streams to continue to, and to qualify to be published on the Foundation's public forums;

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:green;">a. Atleast two members of the Foundation host a podcast.</mark> \ <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">A peer's presentation is always reviewed by another peer. Open Podcast is not the megaphone for individual member's activism. It is the "Voice" of the community. Therefore, a peer's ideas shall be reviewed by another peer.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">b. Moderators: Moderators and interviewers play an important role in channelising an open conversation with fluidity and empathy.</mark> \
A single member participates in the podcast and moderates the conversation. A moderator helps panelists modulate their discussion into something civil, humane and meaningful for our community.üíÅ

<mark style="color:purple;">c. Observer: An observer member participates in the podcast for the episode to qualify as an open podcast.</mark> \
The Observer member may or may not participate as a speaker. \
The observer member generally observes if the podcast stream is within the Foundation's [guiding principles](../guiding-principles.md). Members from different Open Council Committees generally volunteer to be Observers to an open podcast. \

{% endhint %}

So atleast four members come together to host an open podcast. More members may join as panelists depending on the subject, style, theme and nature of the episode. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
### <mark style="color:green;">Platforms where Open Podcasts are hosted:</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">Moderators should use Foundation's recognized communications systems for the advocacy of Foundation's research and</mark> [<mark style="color:green;">objectives</mark>](../articles/objectives.md)<mark style="color:green;">, in a responsible manner.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">The Internet platforms currently used are:</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">Youtube,  Linkedin Live, Spotify</mark>
{% endhint %}

For any hosted open podcast on the Foundation's public forums, [guiding principles](../guiding-principles.md) and [Code of Conduct](../charters/code-of-conduct.md) should be observed by participants. Most importantly, Moderators should moderate the livestreams in accordance with the [Moderation Policy](../data-processing/moderation-policy/).

In addition to above, participants should read special community guidelines for hosting a successful podcast episode.

## An open podcast for all the "voices".

#### Special Community guidelines for hosting and organising an Open Podcast episode:

{% hint style="info" %}
1. <mark style="color:green;">**Multi Lingual:**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">Open Podcast episodes shall be broadcast in any medium of language.</mark> \ <mark style="color:green;">It is recommended to use a single medium of language for an entire episode and depending on the registered attendees demographics.</mark> \ <mark style="color:green;">However, if participating members come from different time zones and regions, multi-lingual podcast episodes should also be organised.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Moderators should play an active role in guiding the conversation of a multi-lingual episode. Media CWC shall assist panelists with speech interpretations, language translation technology and podcast subititles.</mark>
{% endhint %}

<mark style="color:purple;">**2. Differently Abled:**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">If a member is differently abled and due to any reason unable to contribute with their speech, then the member may use a machine translator or a speech machine to express their views in the episode.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">In absence of a speech assist machine, if member(s) know how to communicate using sign language, then the member(s) may choose to do so.</mark> \ <mark style="color:purple;">For more outreach of the member's expressions, Media CWC should assist in adding subtitles to the podcast, with care, sensitivity and empathy.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">Other participating members in an open podcast episode shall take extra precautions in ensuring the privacy of their peer, who is participating without their human speech ability</mark>.

**4. Preserving Children Privacy:**

&#x20;At times, members publish the advocacy of the Foundation's guiding principles in an open podcast episode.&#x20;

We aspire to be a community which is built on the core principle of social inclusion of all human beings. Freedom also comes with responsibilities.&#x20;

Therefore, no member shall publish video, audio, or any form of content, containing sexually explicit imagery in the open podcast. &#x20;

More importantly, members shall take extra precautions in publishing video, audio, or other forms of content, depicting children(read human) below the age of 18 years, by taking due consent of the guardian of the underage human. \
Please reach out to pod@muellners.org for the required 'Release Form' in such cases if you wish to document an underage human in a podcast episode. &#x20;
