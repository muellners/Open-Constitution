#### <mark style="color:green;">**General Instructions to start the open podcast:**</mark>

\
To start the open podcast, one member shall have to ‚ÄúEnter broadcast‚Äù and invite other speakers using the ‚ÄúInvite Guest link‚Äù in the platform. Other members will join through the Guest Link. \
The "Invite Guest Link" can also be found in Streamyard by one admin member. (generally the moderator).

> 1\. The Video Call will then get streamed to Linkedin Live, Youtube, and Twitter on its own.\
> 2\. Streamyard Wiki: Guest instructions for speakers on how to join the broadcast are [https://support.streamyard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043291612?\_gl=1%2A68gygh%2A\_ga%2ANzA5OTUyNzk1LjE2NDEzNzg2Mjc.%2A\_ga\_ESTLDCCGMF%2AMTY0MjA5OTU4NC4yMS4xLjE2NDIwOTk3MTIuNjA](https://support.streamyard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043291612?\_gl=1%2A68gygh%2A\_ga%2ANzA5OTUyNzk1LjE2NDEzNzg2Mjc.%2A\_ga\_ESTLDCCGMF%2AMTY0MjA5OTU4NC4yMS4xLjE2NDIwOTk3MTIuNjA).\
> 3\. _Response to Attendees:_ Comments are enabled on Linkedin Live but disabled on Youtube.(Based on Media Committee‚Äôs suggestion to avoid Spam.)\
> 4\. Some of the Foundation's members remain active during the livestream to participate in the audience interaction in the comments section.

Note: A moderator can invite atmost 10 members through the Guest Invite to participate as panelists, musicians or an act.

{% hint style="info" %}
a. In addition to the community guidelines on the open podcast, members should have a _natural_, _open_ and _thoughtful_ conversation with each other, and have <mark style="color:purple;">**freedom on expression of scientific principles with an open source spirit**</mark>. \
\
b. The open podcasts are attended and seen by <mark style="color:orange;">a global and diverse audience</mark>, joining from all across the world. Therefore, members should only briefly introduce themselves such that the attendees connect with them for the ensuing conversation. \
\
A brief personal introduction should be given by members (generally the moderator introduces but it is always a good idea for each member to speak for themselves). \
\
c. Community consensus proposes members as speakers in these podcasts, who are visible subject matter experts in Foundation's public forum #openpodcast. \
\
These members generally have a public trail of their profile and podcast participants speak more about their experiences on the subject matter. üëçüèº\
\
d. Read Foundation's [list of sensitivity](../data-processing/how-not-to-spam/list-of-sensitivity.md). When expressing ideas on these subjects, members should be encouraged to express in a well articulated maner (to avoid public distortion of member's views) and generally avoiding polarisation of public views. üëåüèø\
\
e. Music üé∂, poems, and any other form of art should be exhibited by the members and if possible, tune in your musical instruments right before the podcast starts. üòí&#x20;

f. _MOST IMPORTANT SOUNDS_ üëÄ: Please broadcast from a peaceful, serene and beautiful space, equipped with noise cancellation. <mark style="color:purple;">This is generally a waterfall, your home office, near sea, or on top of a mountain.</mark> \ <mark style="color:purple;"></mark>\ <mark style="color:purple;"></mark>Members should join the broadcast from a space where there is less to negligible sound interference. Naturally, restaurants dishes, salons should not be your preference spot from where a member broadcasts. \
At times, noise reduction may not be possible in the environment. Speakers should use noise cancellation devices to broadcast their stream from such environments. One of the example is when members may have to join from a Ground Zero or a Crisis spot.    \
