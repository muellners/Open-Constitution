6. Members of CWC work with and counsel their Open Council body to ensure the Foundation's direction is **public facing, open and transparent,** at all times.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
7\. Independent CWC members propose _"Community Proposals"_ in favour of their Core Work group's primary affairs.&#x20;

Any Independent CWC member may initiate a community proposal for Foundation's Open Convention Forums.\

**Escalation Matrix: "Right to be Heard"**

In the case, where Independent CWC and their Open Council body have a difference in the opinion on a critical issue, and their Open Council body has rejected the counsel of CWC(within guideline 6), CWC can escalate the subject to the mailing list of the Observers Council.&#x20;

Note: The Observers Council members are also humans. They may not have a fitting solution to the issue. In this case, CWC is always free to hold a community referendum on the issue.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

8\. CWC members participate in open source communities of projects, outside of what the Foundation maintains or directly supports and defines as a "Project".&#x20;

CWC members represent the Foundation's initiatives in industry events and activities.&#x20;
