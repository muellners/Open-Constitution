# ðŸŽ— CWC Nominations Guide

Each project in the Foundation should have an autonomous Core Working Committee. \
Steering Council independently creates composition and constitution of Core Working Committees of each project. Steering Council also decides the admission criteria to Project CWCs.&#x20;

Whenever a new project is defined in the Foundation's community, the Steering Council members generally begin to constitute the CWC within a month's time.

Besides _Project CWCs_, other Open Council bodies also appoint _Independent CWCs_. These Council bodies also independently create composition and constitution of these _Independent CWCs_, affiliated to their Council's objective.

{% hint style="info" %}
Core Working Committee members are active members in the Foundation's community. CWC membership allows members to actively participate in steering and moving projects and to participate in Foundation's advocacy, different Council initiatives, with more tools and resources of the community.

### **For the** [**Project CWC**](project-cwcs.md) **Nomination:**

Before a community proposal is initiated, to build consensus on a candidate's nomination, candidates shall "_File supporting documents_" to record their nominations in Foundation's records registry. It is a good idea to keep the appropriate Steering Council member, informed of their nomination request.&#x20;

_During the nomination, a candidate shall file only truthful information:_

* [ ] Members should highlight - why do they want to contribute to the specific CWC instead of any other Foundation project? Why are they motivated to work on this project?
* [ ] Members should file their objective analysis on the Project's Roadmap, based on projectâ€™s community discussion?&#x20;
