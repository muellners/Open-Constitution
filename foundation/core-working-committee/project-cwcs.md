# 🧞♂ Project CWCs

### **Role of Project CWCs and its members:**

1. CWC members closely work with [Steering Council](../steering-council/) members appointed to a Project. They are also an active group of contributors to a project. &#x20;
2. CWC members shall contribute to the project documentation for the public facing records.
3. CWC members shall contribute to the project's lifecycle management.
4. CWC members shall contribute to the source code of the project, if it has one, just like any other individual contributor to the project, except they may have additional privilege protocols to act on the project's change requests.
5. CWC members shall introduce new members of the Foundation to their project's documentation.
6. CWC members work with and counsel Steering Council members to ensure project direction is **public facing**, **open and transparent,** at all times.

7\. CWC members propose Community Proposals on behalf of the project.&#x20;

Any CWC member may initiate a community proposal on behalf of a project for Foundation's Open Convention Forums.\
A Steering Council member(appointed to a project) can nominate a community proposal for a Committee Vote.&#x20;

Steering Council ratifies community proposals from Project CWCs and decides whether to accept or reject CWC member's proposals.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Escalation Matrix: "Right to be heard"**\
\
Sometimes Steering Council members and the CWC chair may have a difference in their opinion, regarding a community proposal.

In the case, where CWC & Steering Council of the project have a difference in opinion on a project issue, and the Steering Council has rejected the counsel of CWC(within guideline 6), Project CWC can create a "Right to be heard" to the Observation Council.&#x20;

The Observation Council members are also humans. They may not have a fitting solution to the issue. In this case, Project CWCs are always free to hold a community referendum on the issue.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

8\. CWC members represent the Foundation's project in industry events and activities, and open source communities maintained by other organisations.
