# üî¶ Regulations Council

**The role of the Regulations Council is to provide counsel to the Muellners Foundation's community on its various initiatives.** \
**This Council works on regulations concerning monetary policies, inter-governmental agencies, governmental agencies and the Foundation's statutory maintenance.**

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">Regulations Council members are generally individuals of industry-wide reputation, having had persistent success in contributing to humankind, with a major sustainable impact.</mark> \ <mark style="color:purple;">They can be successful chartered accountants, tax consultants, corporate lawyers, M\&A lawyers, bureaucrats working with government agencies, Program Directors of inter-governmental agencies, holding an office of an institution that shapes the monetary policy of a jurisdiction on this planet.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">Members of this Council may also be industry professionals with a background in Banking, financial services and insurance.</mark>
{% endhint %}

The members of the Regulations Council have voluntarily chosen to actively contribute to the Muellners Foundation's agenda.

These members publish opinion articles on the Foundation's financial technology research and self-governance, contribute directly by mentoring Learn fellowship grantees, participate in presenting the Foundation's agenda in their industry network, and build strategic relationships with governmental and inter-governmental agencies.

The members appointed to the Regulations Council generally stay on this committee for a fixed period.

The members of the Regulations Council may nominate and appoint several Steward Groups, linked to the Fiscal Hosts of the Muellners Foundation. Read more on the [Steward group here](../steward-group.md).

The members of the Regulations Council shall also appoint Regulations CWC, an Independent Core Working Group.

**The members of the Regulations Council work with the following guidelines:**&#x20;

**Meetings:**&#x20;

1\. The Regulations Council members shall meet the Executive Council on an ongoing basis:\
1.1 Generally recorded every month through an electronic meeting with the Executive Council, either exclusively or through Open Convention

1.2 When recorded through the member‚Äôs presence in the Foundation‚Äôs monthly Council meetings, or&#x20;

1.3 When participating through the [Independent Board](../../charters/independent-board.md)'s private mailing list on any Open Council vote, at least once a month. &#x20;

2\. The Regulations Council may convene to meet the Executive Council or other members through an electronic meeting, in addition to the monthly Council meetings, to contribute to the Council's roles and responsibilities.

{% hint style="info" %}
_<mark style="color:green;">The Regulations Council also processes nominations and appointments of members to</mark>_ [_<mark style="color:green;">Steward Groups</mark>_](../steward-group.md) _<mark style="color:green;">and the Open Bank CWC.</mark>_

\
_<mark style="color:green;">Regulations Council members build strategic relationships on behalf of the Foundation's community, representing its citizen's rights in Economic Forums, Regulatory bodies and other industry networks, which are outside the purview of the Open Constitution Partner Program.</mark>_
{% endhint %}

3\. The Regulations Council can convene an electronic meeting, inviting all the Open Council members or all the Foundation's members, to conduct an independent documented review of the Foundation‚Äôs initiatives.&#x20;

The meeting minutes from any convened ‚ÄúRegulations Council meeting‚Äù shall be released to the Executive Council within 14 days of the meeting.&#x20;

The Executive Council reserves the right to reject or release the meeting minutes and documented reviews of this committee to the other members of the Foundation.&#x20;

**Open Constitution Governance Framework:**&#x20;

4\. The Open Constitution network runs itself with a decentralised open governance system. Each open governance decision shall be recorded on the Open Constitution ledger.

Therefore, the role of the Regulations Council is to work with the other Open Council bodies in steering the Foundation‚Äôs self-governance model, inscribed into the Foundation's Open Constitution.&#x20;

The [Executive Council](../executive-council.md) ratifies the Regulations Council‚Äôs Resolutions.&#x20;

The [Independent Board](../../charters/independent-board.md) then ensures ratification of any amendments to this constitution, governance and steering of the Foundation, based on Executive Counsel‚Äôs public reports.

The chair of the Regulations Council may also get elected to an [Open Tribunal](applewebdata://1A42225F-61F8-4746-A38B-9E37E1F74DC6/o/iUCZA8KkVwLfzEQmzt2z/s/-M7ZWDJpXmmuN-OjdQRl/\~/changes/qf7vPuAaGbevpFCeAbez/foundation/open-tribunal), registered on the Open Constitution Governance System for arbitrations between disputing members of the Foundation.
