1.3 When participating through the [Independent Board](../../charters/independent-board.md)'s private mailing list on any Open Council vote, at least once a month. &#x20;

The Steering Council plays a central role in steering the Foundation's roadmap and advocacy of its guiding principles.\
Therefore, a vote of confidence may be scheduled to register the attendance of the Steering Council members.

{% hint style="info" %}
**The members of the Steering Council shall also nominate & appoint the** [**Core Working Committee**](../core-working-committee/)**(CWC) of a project.**

3\. The Steering Council can convene an electronic meeting, inviting all the Open Council members or all the Foundation's members, to conduct an independent documented review of the Foundation‚Äôs project and initiatives.&#x20;

The meeting minutes from any convened ‚ÄúSteering Council meeting‚Äù shall be released to the Open Convention within 14 days of the meeting.&#x20;

The Executive Council reserves the right to reject or release the meeting minutes and documented reviews of this Steering Council to the other members of the Foundation.&#x20;

4\. The Open Constitution Network runs itself with a decentralised open governance system. Each open governance decision shall be recorded on the Open Constitution ledger.

_Executive Council shall keep the Independent Board informed, as it is the Independent Boards that legally ratify any Open Governance decisions within the limitations of local statutes, in accordance with the Local law._
