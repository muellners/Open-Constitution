# 🌱 Steering Council

**The role of the Steering Council is to steer the Open Constitution network's various initiatives.**

Steering Council members are usually individuals of industry-wide reputation, having had persistent success in steering and contributing to humankind, with major sustainable impact. They can be successful entrepreneurs, social leaders, industry professionals, senior scientists, writers, filmmakers,  musicians and artists.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">The members of the Steering Council have chosen to actively contribute to projects maintained by the Foundation. The Steering Council further appoints each project's</mark>[ <mark style="color:purple;">**Core Working Committees**</mark>](../core-working-committee/)<mark style="color:purple;">**.**</mark>&#x20;



<mark style="color:purple;">These members publish opinion articles on the Foundation's open source projects, contribute directly by mentoring Learn fellowship grantees, participate in presenting the Foundation's agenda in their industry network, and build strategic relationships with partners.</mark>



<mark style="color:purple;">The members of the Steering Council stay on the Open Council for an election period</mark>.
{% endhint %}

**The members of the Steering Council work with the following guidelines:**&#x20;

**Meetings:**&#x20;

1\. The Steering Council members shall meet the Executive Council on an ongoing basis:\
1.1 Generally recorded on a monthly basis through an electronic meeting with the Executive Council, either exclusively or&#x20;

1.2 When recorded through the member’s presence in the Foundation’s monthly Council meetings, or&#x20;

1.3 When participating through the [Independent Board](../../charters/independent-board.md)'s private mailing list on any Open Council vote, at least once a month. &#x20;

The Steering Council plays a central role in steering the Foundation's roadmap and advocacy of its guiding principles.\
Therefore, a vote of confidence may be scheduled to register the attendance of the Steering Council members.

{% hint style="info" %}
**The members of the Steering Council shall also nominate & appoint the** [**Core Working Committee**](../core-working-committee/)**(CWC) of a project.**
{% endhint %}

2\. The Steering Council may choose to meet the Executive Council or other members through an electronic meeting, in addition to the monthly Council meetings, to contribute to their roles and responsibilities.

3\. The Steering Council can convene an electronic meeting, inviting all the Open Council members or all the Foundation's members, to conduct an independent documented review of the Foundation’s project and initiatives.&#x20;

The meeting minutes from any convened “Steering Council meeting” shall be released to the Open Convention within 14 days of the meeting.&#x20;

The Executive Council reserves the right to reject or release the meeting minutes and documented reviews of this Steering Council to the other members of the Foundation.&#x20;

**Open Constitution Governance Framework:**&#x20;

4\. The Open Constitution Network runs itself with a decentralised open governance system. Each open governance decision shall be recorded on the Open Constitution ledger.

The [**Executive Council**](../executive-council.md) ratifies the Steering Council’s Resolutions.&#x20;

_Executive Council shall keep the Independent Board informed, as it is the Independent Boards that legally ratify any Open Governance decisions within the limitations of local statutes, in accordance with the Local law._

An [**Independent Board**](../../charters/independent-board.md) ensures the ratification of any amendments to the constitution, governance and administration of the Foundation's project-based decisions.
