# ðŸ“– Community Referendum

Community Proposals, and Council Resolutions may some time go through a community referendum.&#x20;

Community Referendum is one type of electoral process with which Foundation's community builds a consensus.

Community Referendums are registered on Serenity Governance System.

> A **Community Referendum** may also be required if Foundation has opened a public policy investigation with respect to Foundation's [Objective IV](../../objectives.md).
>
> Some of the Open Council appointments, and impeachment objects necessarily go through the Community Referendum.
>
> Arbitration Proceedings between citizens(Open Tribunal) may also use a Community Referendum, upon the request of the Observations Council.
