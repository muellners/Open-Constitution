# ‚òÆ Ethics Council

**The role of the Ethics Council is to advise, observe and steer the human values upon which Muellners Foundation rests.**

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">Members of the Ethics Council of the Open Council of Muellners Foundation are senior lawmakers, distinguished members of judiciary from the democratic governments, ambassadors of peace, leading civil rights activists.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">They have had a persistent success in contributing to the humankind, with a major sustainable impact.</mark>
{% endhint %}

**The members from the Ethics Council work with following guidelines:**&#x20;

**Meetings:**&#x20;

1\. The Ethics Council shall meet the Executive Council on an ongoing basis:\
1.1 Generally recorded on a monthly basis through an electronic meeting with the Executive Committee, either exclusively or&#x20;

1.2 When recorded through the member‚Äôs presence in the Foundation‚Äôs monthly Council meetings, or&#x20;

1.3 When participating through the [Independent Board](../charters/independent-board.md)'s private mailing list on any Open Council vote, atleast once in a month.&#x20;

2\. The Ethics Council members may choose to meet the Executive Council or other members through an electronic meeting, in addition to the monthly Council meetings, to contribute to their roles and responsibilities.&#x20;

The Executive Council reserves the right to reject or accept the meeting minutes and documented reviews of this council.&#x20;

**Open Constitution Governance Framework:**&#x20;

4\. Muellners Foundation runs itself with a decentralized governance model. Ethics Committee works with the other Council members with respect to the Foundation‚Äôs ethics, social values in Foundation's initiatives and projects.&#x20;

The [Executive Council](executive-council.md) ratifies the Ethics Council‚Äôs Resolutions.&#x20;

The [Independent Board](../charters/independent-board.md) then ensures ratification of any amendments to this constitution, governance and steering of the Foundation, based on Executive Council‚Äôs public reports.

The chair of Ethics Council may also get elected to an [Open Tribunal](applewebdata://1A42225F-61F8-4746-A38B-9E37E1F74DC6/o/iUCZA8KkVwLfzEQmzt2z/s/-M7ZWDJpXmmuN-OjdQRl/\~/changes/qf7vPuAaGbevpFCeAbez/foundation/open-tribunal), registered on Open Constitution Governance System for arbitrations between disputing members of the Foundation.
