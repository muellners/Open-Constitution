# üè® Election Council

{% hint style="info" %}
The <mark style="color:green;">Election Council is an autonomous body in the Open Constitution network's global community. It is a standalone and independent Council with its own powers of constitutional governance.</mark>&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The Election Council of the Foundation is an _independent, autonomous, and self-organised_ constitutional body, which is primarily responsible for ensuring fair and transparent General body Elections, and the voting system, maintained using the Serenity project.&#x20;

Election Council is thus responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of Open Ballot.

It is also the organizing body for affairs related to Elections in the Foundation's community.
