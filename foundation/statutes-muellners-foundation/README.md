<mark style="color:green;">Few notes before we start:</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">Bylaws of the Foundation ensure that the Foundation's global citizens stay compliant with different jurisdictions on planet earth.</mark>

These bylaws are written to be adopted by each legally organised voluntary association or a Co-operative, "[Fiscal Host](./#global-offices)" in each identifiable jurisdiction where Foundation's **Open Bank** initiative operates.&#x20;

_<mark style="color:purple;">Each Fiscal Host  adopts these bylaws either as a whole or an Addendum to their existing Articles of Association for the following purpose of these bylaws:</mark>_&#x20;

**Purpose:** The primary objective for adoption of these bylaws are for:

1. <mark style="color:green;">**Constitution of Fiscal Hosts:**</mark>&#x20;

Empanelment of the legal body - Fiscal Host takes place by the Independent Board of the Foundation, based on the counsel of [Advisory Committee](../advisory-council.md).  \
The appointment of a Fiscal Host can be subsequently ratified by any of the pre constituted [Independent Board](independent-board.md)s of any of the existing "Fiscal Hosts" of Muellners Foundation.

<mark style="color:green;">**2. Appointment of Fiscal Host's Independent Board:**</mark>

Independent Board represents the Foundation through Legal bodies in the local jurisdiction, and attempts to ensure Foundation's compliance with these local business and constitutional laws, including maintenance of functions of a [**Fiscal Host**](broken-reference).

<mark style="color:green;">**3. Association of Citizens as laid down by the doctrines of Open Constitution.**</mark>

#### CONVENTION OF LOCAL CITIZENS

{% hint style="info" %}
_Each Fiscal Host maintains a registry of Citizens, who reside in the jurisdiction that the Fiscal Host is constituted in. This registry of Citizens is commonly referred as Serenity's local registry._

_This Article III A explains procedural rules for convening meetings of local citizens in connection with the affairs of the Muellners Foundation._
{% endhint %}

Section 3.1. Place and mode of Convention: Meetings of the members shall be held at the principal office of the foundation in the region or any other place, designated in the notice of the meeting.

Members of the Foundation may participate in a meeting by conference telephone or similar electronic communications systems of the Foundation, by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time. Participating by such means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting.

Section 3.2. Annual Convention of the Local Citizens registered with a Fiscal Host: A meeting of the members, shall be held annually on 10th Jan, each year or at such time as the Independent Board may determine (which shall be, in the case of the first annual meeting, not more than twelve (12) months after the appointment of the Fiscal Host and, in the case of all other meetings, not more than twelve (12) months after the date of the last annual meeting), at which annual meeting the members shall elect an Independent Board of Directors and transact other proper business.

Section 3.3.Special Convention. Special meetings of the members shall be held when directed by the Chair of the Independent Board of Directors or when requested in writing by not less than thirty three percent (33%) of all members, who are registered with the Fiscal Host and entitled to vote at the meeting. The call for the meeting shall be issued by the Secretary, unless the Chair of the Independent Board or members requesting the meeting shall designate another person to do so.

Section 3.4.Notice. Written notice stating the place, mode, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special convention, the purpose or purposes for which the convention is called, shall be issued not less than seven (7) nor more than thirty (30) days before the date of the convention, either personally or electronically, by or at the direction of the Chair of the Independent Board, Chancellor of the Executive Committee of Open Council, the Secretary, or the officer or persons calling the meeting, to each member of Fiscal Host, entitled to vote at such meeting.&#x20;

If digitally issued in Foundation's Open Convention forum, such notice shall be deemed to be issued when addressed to all the members as it appears in the local membership records of the Foundation.

If electronically mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when addressed to the member at his or her or their email address as it appears in the membership records of the Foundation.

Notwithstanding the above paragraph, the Foundation shall not be required to give notice of a members' meeting to any member to whom notice of two consecutive annual meetings, and all notices of meetings or of the taking of action by written consent without a meeting to such member during the period between such two consecutive annual meetings, have been delivered under the procedures outlined above and have been returned undeliverable.&#x20;

Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to such member shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given.&#x20;

If any such member delivers to the Foundation a written notice setting forth their then current email address, the requirement that notice be given to such member shall be reinstated.

Section 3.5.Notice of Adjourned Conventions: When a meeting is adjourned to another time, the Foundation shall not be required to give any notice of the adjourned meeting if the time to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.&#x20;

At the adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If, however, the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment the Independent Board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as provided in Section 3.4 above, to each member of record on the new record date entitled to vote at such meeting.

Section 3.6.Waiver of Notice. Whenever notice is required to be given to any member, a waiver thereof in writing, and electronically signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be the equivalent to the giving of such notice.&#x20;

Attendance by a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the members need be specified in the written waiver of notice.

Section 3.7.Fixing Record Date.

(a) For the purpose of determining members entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of members or any adjournment thereof, the BoD may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the BoD, the record date for determining members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of members shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of members of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of members shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the BoD may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

(b) For purposes of determining the members entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the BoD may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the BoD, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the BoD. If no record date has been fixed by the BoD, the record date for determining members entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Independent Board is required by the local Business Laws, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Foundation by delivery to its registered office, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Foundation having custody of the books in which proceedings of meetings of members are recorded. Delivery made to a Foundation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the BoD and prior action by the BoD is required by the local Business Laws, the record date for determining members entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the BoD adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

(c) For purposes of determining the members entitled to exercise any rights, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the BoD may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining members for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the BoD adopts the resolution relating thereto.

When a specified item of business is required to be voted on by a class or a committee of members (if the members are divided into classes or committees), half (1/2) of such class of members, represented in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of such item of business by that class of members. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the members represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the members, unless the vote of a greater number or voting by class is required by the Business Law of Denmark or _<mark style="color:green;">local law</mark>_ or the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws. The directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the members present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. Where a separate vote by class of members is required, the affirmative vote of a plurality of members of such class represented at the meeting shall be the act of such class unless the vote of a greater number is required by the Business Law of Denmark, or _<mark style="color:green;">local law</mark>_ or the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws.

After a quorum has been established at a members' meeting, the subsequent withdrawal of members, so as to reduce the number of members in person or represented by proxy entitled to vote at the meeting below the number required for a quorum, shall not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.

After a quorum has been established at a members' meeting, the subsequent admission of new members, so as to increase the number of members required for a quorum above the number of members present in person or represented by proxy entitled to vote at the meeting, shall not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.

{% endhint %}

Section 12.2. Acquisition of Legal Representation in the event a member seeks Indemnification: In a legal action by or in the right of the Foundation, if any person who is or was an officer, director or member of the Foundation, or who is or was serving at the request of the Foundation as an officer or director of another legal body, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, and is party to the stated legal action(either as a complainant or a defendent) in enforcing any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding in a local jurisdiction, then such member(s) shall have the ability to exercise an automatic transfer of their legal representation to the Foundation's Legal Committee, with respect to the subject matter.&#x20;

The Power of Attorney shall stand to be quashed if it is ultimately determined that he or she or they are not entitled under applicable law to be indemnified by the Foundation.

Section 12.3. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit.&#x20;

Any member shall be eligible to claim reimbursement of reasonable legal fees incurred by a member in the initial period of a legal action and the claim is made under the stipulations of several Sections of this Article XII, whereby legal expenses concern the period before member or Foundation enforced the Right to Indemnification in accordance with Section 12.1 and subsequent acquisition of Legal representation in accordance with Section 12.2.&#x20;

It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any action or proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the Foundation unless such action is based on the claimant having committed an act involving moral turpitude) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make indemnification permissible under the Business Law of Denmark, or under the Local Law, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Foundation.&#x20;
