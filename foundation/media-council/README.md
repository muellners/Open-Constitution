# 📡 Media Council

**The role of the Global Media Council is to counsel, observe and steer the Open Constitution network's community on media outreach of the Foundation's activities.**

Media Council members are individuals with recognised contributions and publications on social, humanitarian and technology subjects. They have had persistent success in steering advocacy of sustainable ideas and contributing to humankind.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">They are successful journalists, columnists, senior contributors to leading publications, writers, filmmakers, musicians or artists.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">They are columnists and op-ed writers, who express their views on "Social good" and "public policy" in leading publications across the world.</mark>&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**The members of the Media Council work with the following guidelines:**&#x20;

**Meetings:**&#x20;

1\. The Media Council members shall meet the Executive Council on an ongoing basis:\
1.1 Generally recorded every month through an electronic meeting with the Executive Council, either exclusively or through Open Convention

1.2 When recorded through the member’s presence in the Foundation’s monthly Council meetings, or&#x20;

1.3 When participating through the [Independent Board](../../charters/independent-board.md)'s private mailing list on any Open Council vote, at least once in a month. &#x20;

Media Council plays a central role in publishing, advancing and promoting the Foundation's advocacy of its guiding principles.\
Therefore, a vote of confidence may be scheduled to register the attendance of the Media Council members.

2\. The Media Council may convene to meet the Executive Council or other members through an electronic meeting, in addition to the monthly Council meetings, to contribute to their roles and responsibilities.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_<mark style="color:green;">Media Committee also processes nominations and appointments of members to</mark>_ [_<mark style="color:green;">Media CWC</mark>_](media-cwc.md)_<mark style="color:green;">, an</mark>_ [_<mark style="color:green;">Independent CWC</mark>_](../core-working-committee/independent-cwcs.md)_<mark style="color:green;">.</mark>_

\
_<mark style="color:green;">Media Committee members build strategic relationships on behalf of the Foundation's community, representing its citizen's rights in Media Houses, Industry bodies and networks, which are outside the purview of the Open Constitution Partner Program.</mark>_
{% endhint %}

3\. Media Committee can convene an electronic meeting, inviting all the Open Council members or all the Foundation's members, to conduct an independent documented review of the Foundation’s media initiatives.&#x20;

The meeting minutes from any convened “Media Committee meeting” shall be released to the Executive Committee within 14 days of the meeting.&#x20;

The Executive Committee reserves the right to reject or release the meeting minutes and documented reviews of this committee to the other members of the Foundation.&#x20;

**Open Constitution Governance Framework:**&#x20;

4\. The Open Constitution network runs itself with a decentralised open governance system. Each open governance decision shall be recorded on the Open Constitution ledger.

&#x20;Media Council works with all the Open Council bodies concerning the Foundation’s media outreach, spokesmanship of its advocacy and presenting open source projects.&#x20;

The [Executive Council](../executive-council.md) ratifies the Media Council’s Resolutions.&#x20;

The [Independent Board](../../charters/independent-board.md) then ensures ratification of any amendments to this constitution, governance and steering of the Foundation, based on the Executive Council’s public reports.

The chair of the Media Council may also get elected to an [Open Tribunal](applewebdata://1A42225F-61F8-4746-A38B-9E37E1F74DC6/o/iUCZA8KkVwLfzEQmzt2z/s/-M7ZWDJpXmmuN-OjdQRl/\~/changes/qf7vPuAaGbevpFCeAbez/foundation/open-tribunal), registered on the Open Constitution Governance System for arbitrations between disputing members of the Foundation.

**Consideration:**&#x20;

5\. Appointment to this Media Council is pro bono and voluntary. Appointments are generally made for an election period of at least 1 year and almost 3 years.&#x20;

**Appointment, Nomination, Removal and Resignation:**&#x20;

**Appointment:**&#x20;

6.1 **Nomination:** The following members can officially nominate an existing member of the Foundation to the Media Council:&#x20;

6.1 a. An elected member of the [Executive Council](../executive-council.md) or the Media Council or the [Advisory Council](../advisory-council.md).

6.1 b. A non-Council member may also request a nomination, in the form of a community proposal. The Nomination action shall be officially initiated by the only members mentioned in above 6.1 “a”.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:green;">**Electoral Process for "Vote IN" is conditional to a quorum.**</mark>&#x20;

\
<mark style="color:green;">**a.**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">Quorum is achieved when a minimum of half</mark> <mark style="color:green;">of all the Open Council members, participate in the Council Resolution - "Vote IN".</mark>\
<mark style="color:green;">**b.**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">A decision is received in favour of the Council Resolution - "Vote IN", when the majority of all the participating members of the Open Council, vote "+1".</mark>\

\
_<mark style="color:green;">So, in this example, six (+1) votes of the participating 11 Council members will do the job.</mark>_<mark style="color:green;">😒</mark> &#x20;
{% endhint %}

6.4 Appointment to the Media Council is published on the public-facing records of the Muellners Foundation.&#x20;

_<mark style="color:purple;">Further, if a non-Council member has a dispute with a Media Council member, they shall use the Foundation's</mark>_ [_<mark style="color:purple;">**Observer Council**</mark>_ ](../observers-council.md)_<mark style="color:purple;">or the</mark>_ [_<mark style="color:purple;">**Open Tribunal**</mark>_](../open-tribunal.md) _<mark style="color:purple;">to enforce the redressal of their dispute.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:purple;">Media Council members play a central role in the Foundation's global advocacy for social good, technology-based governance, Intellectual property, data privacy and shaping public policy.</mark>_

<mark style="color:red;">At least 11 members shall participate in the Council Resolution for "Vote OUT" to achieve a quorum. This is the qualifying state for the Council Resolution to be locked on the Open Constitution public ledger.</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;">For the removal to be electorally approved for the next stage, the</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**"Vote OUT"**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">should receive at least half of the total votes(required for quorum), in favour of this Council Resolution.</mark>\
\
_<mark style="color:red;">So, in this example, six (+1) votes of the participating 11 Council members will do the job.</mark>_<mark style="color:red;">😒</mark> &#x20;
{% endhint %}

A strong reason for violation of Muellners Foundation’s governing policies and directives must be provided by member(s) initiating the resolution, to support the Council resolution “Vote OUT”.&#x20;

7.3 **Community Referendum:** The final removal of a member from the Media Committee is subject to a community referendum on the passed Council resolution <mark style="color:red;">“Vote OUT”</mark>, stated in 7.1 & 7.2 above.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">Community Referendum is generally accessible by all members of the Muellners Foundation - both Council, its CWC members and non-Council members.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">Quorum on the Community Referendum for the Council Resolution - "Vote Out" is achieved when 33% (more than 1/3rd) of all the voluntarily organised subscribed members participate. Of the minimum participating members, the Community Referendum stands as</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">**Decided**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">when the majority of the quorum populace votes in favour of the stated Council resolution “Vote OUT”.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">E.g.: Let's say there are 1000 Foundation members.</mark>&#x20;



<mark style="color:red;">A minimum of 333 members are required to participate in the Community Referendum to achieve a quorum.</mark> \ <mark style="color:red;">The decision of the Community Referendum depends on a majority(167/333) in favour of, or against the subject of the Referendum.</mark> \
<mark style="color:green;">This is the qualifying stage for the Referendum to get locked on the Open Constitution public ledger.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">😒</mark> &#x20;
{% endhint %}

8\. A member may serve on more than one Open Council body. Each Council body membership reserves additional voting rights.&#x20;

If a member happens to serve on two Open Council bodies, then this effectively means that two votes are counted for the same member for the Foundation’s Council Vote-based decision proceedings, including but not limited to the governing protocols for the appointment of members or their removal to the Open Council.

**Resignation:**&#x20;

9\. A member's self-resignation from the Media Committee is a voluntary action.&#x20;

A member may resign from the Media Committee by stating the reasons for resignation. \
