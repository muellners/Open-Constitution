# âš– Open Tribunal

The purpose of the Open Tribunal is to resolve disputes and claims between members of the Foundation, as well as between different constitutional bodies of the Open Council and independent participants of the Open Constitution Network Tenancy Program. It ensures fair and transparent execution of the Open Constitution and acts as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism for the Foundation's global citizens. The Open Tribunal also focuses on international arbitration and follows the Foundation's guiding principles in resolving disputes.

<mark style="color:green;">The Open Tribunal is an autonomous body in the network's global community. It is a standalone and independent Council with its powers of constitutional governance.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**Role in International Arbitration:**</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">**Open Tribunal**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">also acts as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism for the Foundation's global citizens.</mark>&#x20;



<mark style="color:green;">Open Tribunal may also serve the Foundation's citizens, resolving commercial disputes through an international arbitration framework.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">The Tribunal members shall follow the public-facing Foundation's</mark> [<mark style="color:green;">guiding principles</mark>](../guiding-principles.md) <mark style="color:green;">in resolving disputes.</mark>



Each case logged on the Open Constitution network Governance System and accepted by the Open Tribunal is generally accompanied by a public-facing Observation Report, upon the closure of the case.

Open Tribunal focuses on both **local and International laws on commerce, financial crimes, business & trade laws.**

{% hint style="info" %}
_<mark style="color:red;">**Public Notice:**</mark>_ \
_**A. Appeal for hearing:** <mark style="color:green;">All cases that are accepted in the Open Tribunal framework must be appealed by the network's subscribed citizens for a hearing.</mark>_&#x20;

_The hearing generally takes place via electronic means, well within the_ [_Code of Conduct_](../charters/code-of-conduct/) _and articles & covenants of this Open Constitution._&#x20;

_According to the Statutes, a citizen may also transfer Power of attorney to another member or a constitutional body of the Foundation, to represent them in a dispute._

_**B. Historical Records:** For a case over a commercial dispute, requiring resolution, and which dates back to a date before a citizen's membership in the Foundation(termed a historical case):_&#x20;

_<mark style="color:green;">A historical case may also be accepted by this Open Tribunal if the Foundation's citizens submit an appeal and give consent to the Tribunal, governed by this Open Constitution.</mark>_

It is at the discretion of the Independent Board whether or not to ratify the acceptance of a case into the Open Tribunal.&#x20;

_**C. Case Processing Fees:**_

1. _<mark style="color:green;">There are</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**NO case processing fees**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">for disputes b/w members over the Foundation's governance of projects, public policy affairs and disputes associated with the Foundation's objectives in the financial services industry.</mark>_
2. _<mark style="color:green;">Case processing fees should be collected ONLY for alternate dispute resolution b/w its citizens over a subject of a commercial nature, which prima facie may seem to be outside the purview of the Foundation's ongoing activities, objectives and BFSI industry.</mark>_ &#x20;

_In clearer terms, if citizen disputes are linked to a non Foundation project i.e. a commercial activity **NOT** undertaken or controlled by the Foundation, whether in the financial or non-financial services or technology sector, a case processing fee should be collected._

_3. <mark style="color:green;">Case processing fees should also be collected for alternate dispute resolution b/w two or more Open Constitution Partner Program participants over a subject of a commercial nature. Case Processing Fees are equally borne by the sparring participant entities.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:purple;">Depending on whether a fee is applicable, the case processing fee is to be deposited in the public-facing that Foundation's Fiscal Accounts immediately, before acceptance of the case by the Open Tribunal.</mark>_

**D. Case Processing Time:** The Open Tribunal conducts a hearing where all disputing parties are heard.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">There is no fixed processing time</mark>, however, once an Open Tribunal is constituted and a case is logged on the _Open Constitution_ registry, hearings should commence within 30 days. &#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**E. Binding and Non-Binding resolution:**</mark>&#x20;

_Note: Currently, the Danish law of arbitration supersedes a local law of arbitration, specifically for disputes between the Open Constitution Partner Program entities._

_<mark style="color:purple;">**E3. For NON-Foundation projects/Historical cases appealed by its global citizens:**</mark>_

_<mark style="color:purple;">Depending on the applicable business laws of local jurisdictions, relevant to the case, and structural integrity of the associated local as well as international arbitration laws, the Open Tribunal may process both a binding and a non-binding resolution.</mark>_
