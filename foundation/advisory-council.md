# 🙋 Advisory Council

**The role of the Advisory Council is to advise the Open Constitution network to achieve its goals.**

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">Advisory Council members are usually individuals of industry-wide reputation, having had persistent success in steering and contributing to humankind, with major sustainable impact.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">They can be successful entrepreneurs, social leaders, industry professionals, senior scientists, writers, filmmakers,  musicians and artists.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">The members usually stay on the Advisory Council for a fixed period.</mark>&#x20;


{% endhint %}

**The members of the Advisory Council work with the following guidelines:**

_**Meetings:**_

1\. The Advisory Council shall meet the Executive Council on an ongoing basis:\
1.1 Generally recorded on a monthly basis through an electronic meeting with the Executive Council, either exclusively or through Open Convention.

1.2 When recorded through the member’s presence in the Foundation’s monthly Council meetings, or&#x20;

1.3 When participating through the [Independent Board](../charters/independent-board.md)'s private mailing list on any Council vote, at least once a month. &#x20;

The Advisory Council plays a central role in advising, advancing and promoting the Foundation's advocacy of its guiding principles.\
Therefore, a vote of confidence may be scheduled to register the attendance of the Advisory Council members.

2\. The Advisory Council members may choose to meet the Executive Council or other members through an electronic meeting, in addition to the monthly Council meetings, to contribute to their roles and responsibilities.&#x20;

3\. The Advisory Council can convene an electronic meeting, inviting all the Open Council members or all the Foundation's members, to conduct an independent documented audit or review of the Foundation’s projects and initiatives.&#x20;

The meeting minutes from any convened “Advisory Council meeting” shall be released to the Executive Council within 14 days of the meeting.&#x20;

The Executive Council reserves the right to reject or release the meeting minutes and documented reviews of this Council to the other members of the Foundation.&#x20;

**Open Constitution Governance Framework:**&#x20;

4\. The Open Constitution network runs itself with a decentralised open governance system. Each open governance decision shall be recorded on the Open Constitution ledger.&#x20;

The primary function of the Advisory Council is to work with the other Council members in highlighting advisory on the Foundation’s projects.

The [Executive Council](executive-council.md) ratifies the Advisory Committee’s Resolutions.&#x20;

The [Independent Board](../charters/independent-board.md) then ensures ratification of any amendments to this constitution, governance and steering of the Foundation, based on Executive Counsel’s public reports.

The chair of the Advisory Council may also get elected to an [Open Tribunal](applewebdata://1A42225F-61F8-4746-A38B-9E37E1F74DC6/o/iUCZA8KkVwLfzEQmzt2z/s/-M7ZWDJpXmmuN-OjdQRl/\~/changes/qf7vPuAaGbevpFCeAbez/foundation/open-tribunal), registered on the Open Constitution Governance System for arbitrations between disputing members of the Foundation.

**Consideration:**

5\. Appointment to this Advisory Council is pro bono and voluntary in nature. Appointments are generally made for an election period of at least 1 year and almost 3 years.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
After a member has served on this Council in the preceding year, the community should appoint the former Advisory Council member to the [Observation Council](observers-council.md), subject to its electoral proceedings, but for an indefinite period of time, instead of the fixed time period, as stated in the Observation Council's protocols.
{% endhint %}

**Appointment, Nomination, Removal and Resignation:**&#x20;

**Appointment:**&#x20;

6.1 **Nomination:** The following members can officially nominate an existing member of the Foundation to the Advisory Council:&#x20;

6.1 a. An elected member of the [Executive Council](executive-council.md) or of the [Advisory Council](advisory-council.md).

6.1 b. An individual member may also request a nomination, in the form of community proposals. The Nomination action shall be officially initiated by the only members mentioned in above 6.1 “a”.&#x20;

6.2 Self-nomination by (an already elected) member of one of the bodies of the Open Council for his/her/their appointment to the Advisory Council is not acceptable.

Self nomination by an individual member of the Foundation, for his/her/their appointment to the Advisory Council is not acceptable. [Please read more](../charters/open-governance/peer-review.md).\
\
6.3 Once the nomination is registered by the Nominee, the Nominee or the member nominating the nominee, shall file supporting information such as the nominee's literature, publications, and demonstration of social activities on the Foundation's Membership Registry.&#x20;

A Council Resolution <mark style="color:green;">**"Vote IN"**</mark> is then scheduled on the Council's mailing list.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:green;">**Electoral Process for "Vote IN" is conditional to a quorum.**</mark>&#x20;

\
<mark style="color:green;">**a.**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">Quorum is achieved when a minimum of half</mark> <mark style="color:green;">of all the Open Council members, participate in the Council Resolution - "Vote IN".</mark>\
<mark style="color:green;">**b.**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">A decision is received in favour of the Council Resolution - "Vote IN", when the majority of all the participating members of the Open Council, vote "+1".</mark>\
\ <mark style="color:green;">E.g.: Let's say there are 21 Open Council members.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">At least 11 members shall participate in the Council Resolution for the "Vote IN" to achieve a quorum. This is the qualifying state for the Council Resolution to be logged on the Open Constitution public ledger.</mark>\ <mark style="color:green;">For the appointment to be electorally approved, the "Vote IN" should receive at least half of the total votes(required for quorum), in favour of this Council Resolution.</mark>\
\
_<mark style="color:green;">So, in this example, six (+1) votes of the participating 11 Council members will do the job.</mark>_<mark style="color:green;">😒</mark> &#x20;
{% endhint %}

6.4 Appointment to the Advisory Council is published on the public-facing records of the Foundation.&#x20;

**Removal:**&#x20;

7.2 Open Council Resolution - <mark style="color:red;">“</mark><mark style="color:red;">**Vote OUT**</mark><mark style="color:red;">"</mark> is considered to be active on the Open Constitution system, once it is initiated on the Council’s private mailing list.&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">At least 11 members shall participate in the Council Resolution for "Vote OUT" to achieve a quorum. This is the qualifying state for the Council Resolution to be locked on the Open Constitution public ledger.</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;">For the removal to be electorally approved for the next stage, the</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**"Vote OUT"**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">should receive at least half of the total votes(required for quorum), in favour of this Council Resolution.</mark>\

_<mark style="color:red;">So, in this example, six (+1) votes of the participating 11 Council members will do the job.</mark>_<mark style="color:red;">😒</mark> &#x20;
{% endhint %}

A strong reason for violation of the Foundation’s governing policies and directives must be provided by member(s) initiating the resolution, to support the Council resolution “Vote OUT”.&#x20;

7.3 **Community Referendum:** Final removal of a member from the Advisory Council is subject to a community referendum on the passed Council resolution <mark style="color:red;">“Vote OUT”</mark>, stated in 7.1 & 7.2 above.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">Community Referendum is generally accessible by all members of the Foundation - both Council, CWC members and individual members.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">Quorum on the Community Referendum for the Council Resolution - "Vote Out" is achieved when 33% (more than 1/3rd) of all the voluntarily organised subscribed members participate. Of the minimum participating members, the Community Referendum stands as</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">**Decided**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">when the majority of the quorum populace votes in favour of the stated Council resolution “Vote OUT”.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">E.g.: Let's say there are 1000 Foundation members.</mark>&#x20;



<mark style="color:red;">A minimum of 333 members are required to participate in the Community Referendum to achieve a quorum.</mark> \ <mark style="color:red;">The decision of the Community Referendum depends on a majority(167/333) in favour of, or against the subject of the Referendum.</mark> \
<mark style="color:green;">This is the qualifying state for the Referendum to get locked on the Open Constitution public ledger.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">😒</mark> &#x20;
{% endhint %}

8\. A member may serve on more than one Open Council body. Each Council body membership reserves additional voting rights.&#x20;

If a member happens to serve on two Open Council bodies, then this effectively means that two votes are counted for the same member for the Foundation’s Council Vote-based decision proceedings, including but not limited to the governing protocols for the appointment of members or their removal to the Open Council.

**Resignation:**

9\. A member's resignation from the Advisory Council is a voluntary action.&#x20;

A member may resign from the Advisory Council by stating the reasons for resignation. The announcement of resignation can be done via electronic email on the Council's mailing list.

10\. The [Independent Board](../charters/independent-board.md) reserves the right to update the terms and conditions, and statutes from time to time, in compliance with the existing rules and regulations of the association, including reserving the right to terminate the appointment to this Council at any time, without notice and without the due electoral process of removal, in the following scenario:

_If the member is found convicted of criminal, civil and financial crimes, in any court of competent jurisdiction, across the world, where the Foundation has an active presence, either through a legal body representation or an affiliate network._
