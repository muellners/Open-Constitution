# üçØ Treasury Council

**The role of the Treasury Council is to steer the Open Constitution network's various initiatives with fund appropriations, and governance rules on co-operative owned fund management.**

\
Treasury Council members are generally individuals of industry-wide reputation, having had persistent success in steering and contributing to humankind, with major sustainable impact. They can be successful bankers, investment fund managers, wealth managers, senior financial analysts, scheduled and chartered auditors, accountants, members with background in tax compliance, and public grants. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">The members of the Treasury Council have voluntarily chosen to actively contribute to projects maintained by the Muellners Foundation.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**These members contribute to the Open Bank's Fund appropriation, allocation and provisioning to different projects of the Foundation.**</mark> \
<mark style="color:purple;">Treasury Council members also participate in presenting the Foundation's agenda in local industry forums and chamber networks and build strategic relationships with Hedge Funds, Venture Capital and Private Equity and Crypto Holding Financial Services companies.</mark>



<mark style="color:purple;">The members of the Treasury Council generally stay on the Committee for a fixed period</mark>.
{% endhint %}

**The members of the Treasury Council work with the following guidelines:**&#x20;

**Meetings:**&#x20;

1\. The Treasury Council members shall meet the Executive Council on an ongoing basis:\
1.1 Generally recorded every month through an electronic meeting with the Executive Council, either exclusively or&#x20;

1.2 When recorded through the member‚Äôs presence in the Foundation‚Äôs monthly Council meetings, or&#x20;

1.3 When participating through the [Independent Board](../charters/independent-board.md)'s private mailing list on any Open Council vote, at least once a month. &#x20;

Treasury Council plays a central role in fund appropriation, and representing Foundation's investment and Fiscal host relationships. \
Treasury Council contributes to actively steering the Foundation's roadmap and advocacy of its guiding principles.\
Therefore, a vote of confidence may be scheduled to register the attendance of the Treasury Council members.

{% hint style="info" %}
**The members of the Treasury Council shall also nominate members to the** [**Steward Group**](steward-group.md)**.**
{% endhint %}

2\. The Treasury Council may convene to meet the Executive Council or other members through an electronic meeting, in addition to the monthly Council meetings, to contribute to their roles and responsibilities.

3\. The Treasury Council may convene an electronic meeting, inviting all the Open Council members or all the Foundation's members, to conduct an independent documented review of the Foundation‚Äôs project and initiatives.&#x20;

The meeting minutes from any convened ‚ÄúTreasury Council meeting‚Äù shall be released to the Executive Council within 14 days of the meeting.&#x20;

The Executive Council reserves the right to reject or release the meeting minutes and documented reviews of this council to the other members of the Foundation.&#x20;

**Open Constitution Governance Framework:**&#x20;

4\. The Open Constitution network runs itself with a decentralised open governance system. Each open governance decision shall be recorded on the Open Constitution ledger.

Treasury Council works with all the Open Council members concerning the Foundation‚Äôs open source projects.

The [Executive Council](executive-council.md) ratifies the Treasury Council‚Äôs Resolutions.&#x20;

The [Independent Board](../charters/independent-board.md) then ensures ratification of any amendments to the open constitution, and governance of the Open Bank, based on the Executive Council‚Äôs public reports.

The chair of the Treasury Council may also get elected to an [Open Tribunal](applewebdata://1A42225F-61F8-4746-A38B-9E37E1F74DC6/o/iUCZA8KkVwLfzEQmzt2z/s/-M7ZWDJpXmmuN-OjdQRl/\~/changes/qf7vPuAaGbevpFCeAbez/foundation/open-tribunal), registered on the Open Constitution Governance System for arbitrations between disputing members of the Foundation.
