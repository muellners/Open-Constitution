<mark style="color:green;">**Executive Committee is an apex constitutional body and is constituted from the Foundation's Open Council and the member's appointment is an electoral process.**</mark>

> **About Nominations:** A candidate may self nominate themselves for the membership to Executive Committee.
>
> Before a candidate files for nomination to the Executive Committee, following should be taken into consideration:
>
> 1. Candidates should already be serving on one of the organs of the Open Council, in the election year or in the preceeding year to the election.
> 2. Candidates should have demonstrated community consensus and have actively participated in Foundation's purposes and initiatives.
> 3. (For 2019-2022)Maximum number of candidate nominations are proportionate to the size of community. For each 100 community member, a single candidate nomination is applicable.&#x20;
>
> E.g If there are 1000 members, then for an election year, not more than 10 nominations seat for Executive Committee may be filed.\
>

Note: Each Council Committee appoints a single member(generally the Committee's Chair) to reserve a vote on whether to accept or reject a candidate's nomination.&#x20;

This means that each Council Committee Chair naturally holds a Veto against a nomination.&#x20;

This ensures that quality leadership and human virtues are upheld during the election process. (Read more on what each [Committee](committees-and-their-roles/) is responsible for.)

Once a candidate's nominations achieve quorum with the Council committees, all nominations are then put to vote by the community.&#x20;

**On Election:** \
Each community member has a single vote for a candidate's nomination.&#x20;

The candidates who receive more than half of all votes registered by participating community members are then appointed to the Executive Committee.&#x20;

**After Election:**\
The elected members of the Executive Committee shall then resolve to appoint a **Chancellor** amongst themselves.

A general guideline is to appoint a Chancellor with the highest number of votes received in the election.&#x20;
