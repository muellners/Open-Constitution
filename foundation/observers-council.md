# üî≠ Observers Council

**As the name suggests, the role of the Observer Council is to observe the Muellners Foundation's various initiatives and ensure that the Foundation is in compliance with its vision & purpose.**

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">Observation Council members are usually individuals of industry-wide reputation.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">They have had persistent success in steering and contributing to humankind, with a major sustainable impact.</mark> \ <mark style="color:purple;">They can be successful product engineers, fintech industry professionals, scientists, industry managers, researchers, youth leaders, and social media influencers.</mark> \
\ <mark style="color:purple;">The members of the Observer Council have chosen to actively contribute to the Muellners Foundation's agenda.</mark>\
\
<mark style="color:purple;">These members publish opinion articles on the Foundation's open-source projects, participate in presenting the Foundation's agenda in their industry network, and build strategic relationships with partners.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">The primary role that these members play is to ensure that the Muellners Foundation's activities are in compliance with its manifesto.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">Therefore, they observe and analyse the Foundation's key initiatives and publish their findings periodically.</mark> \
\ <mark style="color:purple;">The members of the Observer Council generally stay on the Council for a fixed period.</mark>
{% endhint %}

**The members of the Observer Council work with the following guidelines:**

_**Meetings:**_

1\. The Observation Council members shall meet the Executive Council on an ongoing basis:\
Generally recorded on a monthly basis through an electronic meeting with the Executive Council, either exclusively or through Open Convention.

1.2 When recorded through the member‚Äôs presence in the Foundation‚Äôs monthly Council meetings, or&#x20;

1.3 When participating through the [Independent Board](../charters/independent-board.md)'s private mailing list on any Council vote, at least once a month. &#x20;

The Observation Council plays a central role in observing, advancing and promoting the Foundation's advocacy of its guiding principles.\
Therefore, a vote of confidence may be scheduled to register the attendance of the Observation Council members.

2\. The Observation Council members may choose to meet the Executive Council or other members through an electronic meeting, in addition to the monthly Council meetings, to contribute to their roles and responsibilities.&#x20;

3\. Observation Council can convene an electronic meeting, inviting all the Open Council members or all the Foundation's members, to conduct an independent documented audit or review of the Foundation‚Äôs projects and initiatives.&#x20;

The meeting minutes from any convened ‚ÄúObservation Council meeting‚Äù shall be released to the Executive Council within 14 days of the meeting.&#x20;

The Executive Council reserves the right to reject or release the meeting minutes and documented reviews of this council to the other members of the Foundation.&#x20;

\
**Open Constitution Governance Framework:**&#x20;

4\. Muellners Foundation runs itself with a decentralised open governance system. Each open governance decision shall be recorded on the Open Constitution ledger.

Observation Council works with all the Open Council members with respect to the Foundation‚Äôs projects, spokesmanship of its advocacy and maintaining open source projects, licensing and infrastructure.&#x20;

The [Executive Council](executive-council.md) ratifies the Observer Council‚Äôs Resolutions.&#x20;

The [Independent Board](../charters/independent-board.md) then ensures ratification of any amendments to this constitution, governance and steering of the Foundation, based on Executive Counsel‚Äôs public reports.

The chair of the Observation Council may also get elected to an [Open Tribunal](applewebdata://1A42225F-61F8-4746-A38B-9E37E1F74DC6/o/iUCZA8KkVwLfzEQmzt2z/s/-M7ZWDJpXmmuN-OjdQRl/\~/changes/qf7vPuAaGbevpFCeAbez/foundation/open-tribunal), registered on the Open Constitution Governance System for arbitrations between disputing members of the Foundation.

**Consideration:**

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:green;">**Electoral Process for "Vote IN" is conditional to a quorum.**</mark>&#x20;

\
<mark style="color:green;">**a.**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">Quorum is achieved when a minimum of half</mark> <mark style="color:green;">of all the Open Council members, participate in the Council Resolution - "Vote IN".</mark>\
<mark style="color:green;">**b.**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">A decision is received in favour of the Council Resolution - "Vote IN", when the majority of all the participating members of the Open Council, vote "+1".</mark>\

A strong reason for violation of Muellners Foundation‚Äôs governing policies and directives must be provided by member(s) initiating the resolution, to support the Council resolution ‚ÄúVote OUT‚Äù.&#x20;

7.3 **Community Referendum:** Final removal of a member from the Observation Council is subject to a community referendum on the passed Council resolution <mark style="color:red;">‚ÄúVote OUT‚Äù</mark>, stated in 7.1 & 7.2 above.&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">Community Referendum is generally accessible by all members of the Muellners Foundation - both Council, CWC members and non-Council members.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">Quorum on the Community Referendum for the Council Resolution - "Vote Out" is achieved when 33% (more than 1/3rd) of all the voluntarily organised subscribed members participate.

8\. A member may serve on more than one Open Council body. Each Council body membership reserves additional voting rights.&#x20;

If a member happens to serve on two Open Council bodies, then this effectively means that two votes are counted for the same member for the Foundation‚Äôs Council Vote-based decision proceedings, including but not limited to the governing protocols for the appointment of members or their removal to the Open Council.

**Resignation:**

9\. A Member's resignation from the Observer Council is a voluntary action.&#x20;
