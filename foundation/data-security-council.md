# üìµ Data Security Council

**The role of the Data Security Council is to act on the Foundation's citizen privacy, security and enforcement of data protection rights of Muellners Foundation's community on its several public initiatives.** \
**This Council works on data security regulations, concerning communications policies.**

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">Data Security Council members are generally individuals of industry-wide reputation, having had persistent success in contributing to humankind, with a major sustainable impact.</mark> \ <mark style="color:purple;">They can be successful members of civil rights society, corporate lawyers, M\&A lawyers, and holding an office of an institution that shapes data security policies of jurisdiction on this planet such as bureaucrats working with governmental data protection agencies and data Security Program Directors of intergovernmental agencies.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">Members of this Council may also be industry professionals with a background in Banking, financial services insurance and other global value chain constituents.</mark>
{% endhint %}

The members of the Data Security Council have voluntarily chosen to actively contribute to the Foundation's agenda.

These members publish opinion articles on the Foundation's data protection research and self-governance, contribute directly using participation in presenting the Foundation's agenda in their industry network, and build strategic relationships with governmental and inter-governmental data protection agencies.

The members appointed to the Data Security Council generally stay on this committee for a fixed period.

The members of the Data Security Council may nominate and appoint several Steward Groups, linked to the Fiscal Hosts of the Muellners Foundation as their fiduciary duty. Read more on the [Steward group here](steward-group.md).

The members of the Data Security Council shall also participate in the constitution of Independent Core Working Groups like [Open Bank CWC](regulations-council/open-bank-cwc.md) or [Media CWC](media-council/media-cwc.md).

**The members of the Data Security Council work with the following guidelines:**&#x20;

**Meetings:**&#x20;

1\. The Data Security Council members shall meet the Executive Council on an ongoing basis:\
1.1 Generally recorded every month through an electronic meeting with the Executive Committee, either exclusively or through Open Convention

1.2 When recorded through the member‚Äôs presence in the Foundation‚Äôs monthly Council meetings, or&#x20;

1.3 When participating through the [Independent Board](../charters/independent-board.md)'s private mailing list on any Open Council vote, at least once a month. &#x20;

2\. The Data Security Council may convene to meet the Executive Council or other members through an electronic meeting, in addition to the monthly Council meetings, to contribute to the Council's roles and responsibilities.

3\. The Data Security Council can convene an electronic meeting, inviting all the Open Council members or all the Foundation's members, to conduct an independent documented review of the Foundation‚Äôs initiatives.&#x20;

The meeting minutes from any convened ‚ÄúData Security Council meeting‚Äù shall be released to the Executive Council within 14 days of the meeting.&#x20;

The Executive Council reserves the right to reject or release the meeting minutes and documented reviews of this council to the other members of the Foundation.&#x20;

**Open Constitution Governance Framework:**&#x20;

4\. Muellners Foundation runs itself with a decentralised governance system. Therefore, the role of the Data Security Council is to work with the other Open Council bodies in steering the Foundation‚Äôs self-governance model, inscribed into the Foundation's Open Constitution.&#x20;

The [Executive Council](executive-council.md) ratifies the Data Security Council‚Äôs Resolutions.&#x20;

The [Independent Board](../charters/independent-board.md) then ensures ratification of any amendments to this constitution, governance and steering of the Foundation, based on Executive Counsel‚Äôs public reports.

The chair of the Data Security Council may also get elected to an [Open Tribunal](applewebdata://1A42225F-61F8-4746-A38B-9E37E1F74DC6/o/iUCZA8KkVwLfzEQmzt2z/s/-M7ZWDJpXmmuN-OjdQRl/\~/changes/qf7vPuAaGbevpFCeAbez/foundation/open-tribunal), registered on the Open Constitution Governance System for arbitrations between disputing members of the Foundation.

{% endhint %}

A strong reason for violation of Muellners Foundation‚Äôs governing policies and directives must be provided by member(s) initiating the resolution, to support the Council resolution ‚ÄúVote OUT‚Äù.&#x20;

7.3 **Community Referendum:** The final removal of a member from the Data Security Council is subject to a community referendum on the passed Council resolution <mark style="color:red;">‚ÄúVote OUT‚Äù</mark>, stated in 7.1 & 7.2 above.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">Community Referendum is generally accessible by all members of the Muellners Foundation - both Council, its CWC members and non-Council members.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">Quorum on the Community Referendum for the Council Resolution - "Vote Out" is achieved when 33% (more than 1/3rd) of all the voluntarily organised subscribed members participate. Of the minimum participating members, the Community Referendum stands as</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">**Decided**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">when the majority of the quorum populace votes in favour of the stated Council resolution ‚ÄúVote OUT‚Äù.</mark>

8\. A member may serve on more than one Open Council body. Each Council body membership reserves additional voting rights.&#x20;

If a member happens to serve on two Open Council bodies, then this effectively means that two votes are counted for the same member for the Foundation‚Äôs Council Vote-based decision proceedings, including but not limited to the governing protocols for the appointment of members or their removal to the Open Council.

**Resignation:**&#x20;

9\. A member's self-resignation from the Data Security Council is a voluntary action.&#x20;
