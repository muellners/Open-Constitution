# ðŸ—ž Join Open Council!

Foundation promotes outstanding socially inclined individuals from all corridors of human life, and promotes sentient leadership in its community. &#x20;

We believe all community members have a stake in decision making and governance of Foundation's initiatives.

If you are an individual member, with a keen interest in attaining a [Council membership](./), to drive the Foundation's agenda forward, please guide yourself with following community principles:

### For any of these Open Council committees:

### Steering, Media, Treasury committee.&#x20;

> "A leader is inherently a follower of community's voice.&#x20;
>
> Your membership to Council committee is a responsible role to lead community members forward.&#x20;
>
> To do justice to the role of leadership, members seeking a nomination, shall be understanding, and empathetic towards other members.&#x20;
>
> These Committee members have a larger role in ensuring democratic representation of non committee members also."&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**STEP 1:** **Steady and visible contribution:**&#x20;

If you are here, and reading this, it should be assumed that you have been contributing to Foundation's steering activities and creating a positive recognition of your contribution, amongst your peers, generally over a consistent period of time**.**

Foundation members understand that the contributions are subjective.&#x20;

An individual member shall strive to create impact with their contribution, such that other committee members should be able to endorse the member's nomination to any of the above Council committees.&#x20;

Any member seeking a Council committee membership, shall deepen their engagement in the community, with their selfless contributions.
