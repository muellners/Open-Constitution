# 🦉 Open Council

The Open Constitution Network constitutes an Open Council, which depends on pillars of "_representational democracy" and is governed by these Articles of Open Constitution._

**About Core Working Committees:**

Besides the above Open Council bodies, autonomous and self-governing [Core Working Committees](../core-working-committee/)(CWCs) are associated with these Councils.&#x20;

There are fundamentally two types of CWCs - \
[Project CWC](../core-working-committee/project-cwcs.md)s contributing to the projects and;

[Independent CWC](../core-working-committee/independent-cwcs.md)s contribute to the collective affairs of the Foundation, whether these activities are associated with a specific project or not.

A nomination is generally initiated by existing members of the Council. Any Open Council member can nominate any other member of the Foundation's community.&#x20;

Members can also nominate any person from outside the network's ecosystem, as long as the [Open Access](../../charters/open-access-charter.md) guidelines of this Open Constitution have been followed.

_Self-nomination is unfortunately not acceptable_.  \
\
All appointments to the Open Council (except the Executive Council itself) are ratified by the electorally appointed Chancellor on behalf of the Executive Council. \
The Chancellor of the Open Council shall counsel the Independent Board of a Fiscal Host, of all the Local appointments constituted in each election period, and such appointments shall be recorded on public-facing records of Meeting Minutes.&#x20;

Each body of the Open Council governs itself using this Open Constitution.&#x20;
