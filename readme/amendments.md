_**Open Constitution Global Statutes are divided into different constitutional bodies.**_ \
_Articles of association for each constitutional body of the Open Constitution are detailed and presented on a single page of this Open Constitution._&#x20;

_Each page is, therefore, known as a single **instrument** of the Open Constitution._&#x20;

Each **instrument** is bound by a specific custodian, an Open Council body which is responsible for maintaining, legislating, and amending the laws enacted in the Foundation's self-governance model.
