# ðŸ§° Amendments

> "Change is eternal to human and humankind. Sometimes to adapt to change, willingness to change is required from within each and every human being."

_Before we begin, an individual citizen should gain access to the Foundation's Gitbook to initiate change requests to this <mark style="color:red;">**LIVE VERSION**</mark> of the Open Constitution._&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">This is generally accorded when members join the Foundation. Read</mark> [<mark style="color:purple;">Open Access</mark>](../charters/open-access-charter.md) <mark style="color:purple;">levels.</mark>

_**Open Constitution is divided into different constitutional bodies.**_ \
_Articles of association for each constitutional body of the Open Constitution are detailed and presented on a single page of this Open Constitution._&#x20;

_Each page is therefore known as a single **instrument** of the Open Constitution._&#x20;

Each **instrument** is bound by a specific custodian, either a Council or a Committee, which is responsible for upkeep and amendment of the laws, enacted in the Foundation's self-governance model.

> ## ARTICLE X AMENDMENTS
>
> \
> These Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed by the members, or by the Executive Council and new Bylaws may be adopted by the Executive Council or by the members.&#x20;
>
> No alteration, amendment or repeal of these Bylaws shall be effective unless and until the Foundation attempts, in good faith, to issue notice to the members of the Foundation of such alteration, amendment or repeal at least fifteen (15) days prior to the effective date of such alteration, amendment or repeal, which notice may be by electronic means.
