# ðŸ§° Amendments

> "Change is eternal to human and humankind. Sometimes to adapt to change, willingness to change is required from within each and every human being."

_Before we begin, an individual citizen should gain access to the Foundation's Gitbook to initiate change requests to this <mark style="color:red;">**LIVE VERSION**</mark> of the Open Constitution._&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">This is generally accorded when members join the Foundation. Read</mark> [<mark style="color:purple;">Open Access</mark>](../charters/open-access-charter.md) <mark style="color:purple;">levels.</mark>

_**Open Constitution is divided into different constitutional bodies.**_ \
_Articles of association for each constitutional body of the Open Constitution are detailed and presented on a single page of this Open Constitution._&#x20;

_Each page is therefore known as a single **instrument** of the Open Constitution._&#x20;

Each **instrument** is bound by a specific custodian, either a Council or a Committee, which is responsible for upkeep and amendment of the laws, enacted in the Foundation's self-governance model.

> ## ARTICLE X AMENDMENTS

> These Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed by the members, or by the Executive Council and new Bylaws may be adopted by the Executive Council or by the members.&#x20;
