_<mark style="color:purple;">Each Fiscal Host adopts these bylaws either as a whole or an Addendum to their existing Articles of Association for the following purposes:</mark>_&#x20;

**Purpose:** The primary objective for the adoption of these bylaws is for:

Empanelment of the legal body - Fiscal Host takes place by the Independent Board of the Foundation, based on the counsel of the [Advisory Committee](../../foundation/advisory-council.md).  \
The appointment of a Fiscal Host can be subsequently ratified by any of the pre-constituted [Independent Board](../../charters/independent-board.md)s of any of the existing "Fiscal Hosts" of the Foundation.
