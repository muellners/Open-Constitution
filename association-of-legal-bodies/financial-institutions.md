## **2. APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE:**&#x20;

An E-Tenant shall nominate and appoint at least one(1) representative member(a natural person or a group of natural persons who are affiliated with the E-Tenant_, in accordance with the local business laws)_ to the Open Constitution body: **Observers Council.**&#x20;

Any such representation shall be duly authorised by the governing body of the _E-Tenant_ in accordance with the local law.

Any such representation of a duty-bound nominee shall have received signatory rights on behalf of the E-Tenant, in full compliance with the local law.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_<mark style="color:purple;">An E-Tenant e.g. an institution may appoint e.g. a Board Committee or an Officer or an employee of the institution to the Observers Council.</mark>_
{% endhint %}

Any nomination, appointment, or termination of the representative shall follow the Articles of Association of Natural Persons: [Observers Council](../foundation/observers-council.md), and subsequently any change of representation shall also be ratified in accordance with the [Global Statutes](../articles/statutes-muellners-foundation/).

**2.1 ROLE OF A SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE APPOINTEE(S) IN NETWORK TENANCY:**

2.1.1 At least one(1) representative Appointee shall be appointed, and who shall have the powers to represent and legally bind the _E-Tenant_ in availing the authenticated authorization to the data registry of the Embedded Knowledge Base(EKB) of the Open Constitution AI network, maintained by the Foundation.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_<mark style="color:purple;">A Special Representative Appointee shall have the powers to propose governance motions for contributing ''Work'' to the lifecycle of the Embedded Knowledge Base(EKB) of the AI network, by participating in conventions with ordinary voluntary members of the public association(other E Residents) and other E-Tenants, by means of activating a project tenancy.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:purple;">The E-residents of the AI network contribute through the Contribution Delivery Subnet, where the E-tenant also contribute. The AI on the network is reduced to practice in open source, through the attribution of Open Constitution Network's License.</mark>_
{% endhint %}

2.1.2  The Special Representative Appointee discharges any responsibility to the public association within the purview and scope of these Global Statutes: Articles of Association of Legal Bodies: Open Constitution.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_<mark style="color:purple;">Subject to the condition of clause 2.1.1,  in managing the authenticated authorization, this article declares that the representative Appointee expresses an explicit Waiver of Indemnification rights, generally granted to any natural persons appointee on the network, for activities on the network.</mark>_&#x20;

_<mark style="color:purple;">i.e. Representative Appointees are liable within the compliance framework of their Institution when they access Project Tenancy. But their actions may influence the network, whether accidental adversity or for good. Therefore, the legal liability and privilege are associated with the institution(read E-Tenant) to which the representative appointee is affiliated, and not the natural person themselves.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:purple;">In matter(s) concerning the Network Tenancy or any communications or publishing or release proceeding(s) thereof shall take place in accordance with the active Charters of these Global Statutes. An E-tenant is a recognized member of the public association as much as a natural person( a human member) is, except the legal personhood and the capacity of the legal personhood varies between the two. While the latter, an E-Resident(a natural person) is accorded indemnification privillege when serving on behalf of the Public Association, an E-Tenant is not accorded such indemnification due to the transparent conflict of interest of core pursuit. The E-Tenant exists in the AI network framework to avail benefits for their associated beneficiaries. But the activites of E-Tenant, including participating in the Open Constitution Network is based on the legal status of the body.</mark>_ &#x20;
{% endhint %}

_2.1.3_ It is at the discretion of the Special Representative Appointee whether an explicit waiver of confidentiality remains, increased or diminished in connection to each exchange of any confidential information, and any material thereof between the E-Tenant and the Network through the authenticated authorization&#x20;
