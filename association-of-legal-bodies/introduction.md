# üè≥ Introduction

The governing articles outline the access and appointment policies for E-Tenants in the Open Constitution AI network. E-Tenants are granted authorized access to the data registry of the Embedded Knowledge Base (EKB) and can nominate a representative member to the Observers Council. The Special Representative Appointee has powers to propose governance motions and is liable within the institution's compliance framework. Tenancy conventions are organized by the Special Representative Appointee(s), primarily through electronic means, and dissolution of network tenancy can be done by either the Executive Council or the governing body of an E-Tenant. Disputes can be resolved through mediation or arbitration in an Open Tribunal governed by applicable business laws. The Executive Council reserves the right to update network terms and conditions, including terminating an E-Tenant's representative if convicted of criminal activities.

The page provides a concise overview of its main points related to beneficiary access, the appointment of representatives, tenancy conventions, dissolution procedures, and dispute resolution mechanisms within Open Constitution AI Network's governance structure.
