# 🏳️ Introduction

The governing articles outline the access and appointment policies for E-Tenants in the Open Constitution AI network. E-Tenants are granted authorized access to the data registry of the Embedded Knowledge Base (EKB) and can nominate a representative member to the Observers Council. The Special Representative Appointee has powers to propose governance motions and is liable within the institution's compliance framework. Tenancy conventions are organized by the Special Representative Appointee(s), primarily through electronic means, and dissolution of network tenancy can be done by either the Executive Council or the governing body of an E-Tenant. Disputes can be resolved through mediation or arbitration in an Open Tribunal governed by applicable business laws. The Executive Council reserves the right to update network terms and conditions, including terminating an E-Tenant's representative if convicted of criminal activities.

The page provides a concise overview of its main points related to beneficiary access, the appointment of representatives, tenancy conventions, dissolution procedures, and dispute resolution mechanisms within Open Constitution AI Network's governance structure.

> The "Open Constitution" Network Tenancy Access allows institutions and organizations to participate in the Open Source Ecosystem. Strategic partnerships are welcomed with academic and non-academic institutions, for-profit and non-for-profit companies, scientists and engineers, online forums, and open-source communities. The Network Tenancy provides opportunities for tenants to develop open-source intellectual property for social financial services such as fintech services. Not-for-profit companies focused on financial inclusion, social inclusion, and climate protection activities can also qualify as Fiscal Hosts. Educational institutions with a focus on STEM, global health, global development, arts & music can join the network. Inter-government agencies recognized by the United Nations can advance research activities through the Open Constitution AI Network. Governments and government agencies that provide identity services within local law regulations are invited to be part of the network.
