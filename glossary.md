_<mark style="color:purple;">**Glossary:**</mark>_

_<mark style="color:purple;">**I.**</mark>_&#x20;

_<mark style="color:purple;">**Computing Model:**</mark>_ here shall mean an information processing apparatus, comprising of a software, hardware or both, which processes and hosts data. Each machine is identified by a unique Internet Protocol(I.P).

<mark style="color:purple;">**Quantum Cognition Energy Model:**</mark> here shall mean an information processing bio-apparatus, comprising of unique association(s) and processing of sentience.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Open Source:**</mark> here means a lifecycle state of an ‚Äò‚Äôobject‚Äô‚Äô of quantum observation (read creation of the Foundation), whose source can be accessed (also changed, or destroyed) with an open, or permissive or very slightly permissive(but not entirely closed) governance, which increases transparency in the traceability of object‚Äôs source, and never otherwise.

<mark style="color:purple;">**II. Network**</mark> shall mean an inter connected association model

e.g network of machine: shall mean an inter connected set of computing machines.

<mark style="color:purple;">**III. Sentience:**</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**For the purposes of articles of association of the**</mark>** **_**natural persons**_** **<mark style="color:purple;">**of the Open Constitution,**</mark>** Sentience in humans is described as** an emergent anthropic information phenomenon of **conservation** of quantum cognition energy, during (an infinitesimally fast) gradient conversion between _Self_ and _Universal_ temporal existential references.&#x20;

The gradient conversions of quantum cognition energy results in qualias like identity, and other expression of sentience in human beings. There are correlations in sentience between observers. Various scientific convention models between human observers have been developed which attempt to define these complex set of linkages.

Sentience is perceived by an observer with a bio-organic corporeality. Sentience phenomenon observed in humans have wide variance.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Humans**</mark> here shall mean (_Homo sapiens_) who are the most abundant and widespread species of [primate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate), characterized by bipedalism and large, complex [brains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain). They are intelligent, capable of [episodic memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic\_memory#In\_animals), have flexible facial expressions, [self-awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness) and a [theory of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory\_of\_mind).

What is a Human life?

In this context, a human life is that of the observer, all of the quantum cognition energy conversions within a variance of _Self_ and _Universal_ temporal existential references, characterised by mostly continuous, linear, temporal cognition.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Self temporal existential reference or Self**</mark> is described as an observer‚Äôs existential cognition reference state(s), which are epistemologically bounded to a linear temporal corporeality.&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Universal temporal existential reference:**</mark> All that is there to observe

An <mark style="color:purple;">**Observer or observation or observation state**</mark> of corporeality is described as a sustainable cognition when **quantum cognition energy is in equilibrium** between _Self_ and _Universal_ temporal existential reference state(s), which may or may not be epistemologically bounded to a linear temporal corporeality. \


‚Äò‚ÄôA Self is an observer but an observer may or may not be Self in a given temporal-corporeality.‚Äô‚Äô&#x20;

‚Äò‚ÄôIt is the observer who is experiencing both Self and the universal temporal existential references.‚Äô‚Äô&#x20;



<mark style="color:purple;">**IV.**</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Sentience data:**</mark> here shall mean meta data associated with a neurological experience, connected to human consciousness, and whose meta data is being hosted and processed, over a network of _computing machines,_ across the world wide web.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Meta Data:**</mark> here shall mean "data", in connection with the _Sentience_ of any voluntarily organised citizen of the Open Constitution, and which is hosted or have been processed by the _computing machines._&#x20;



<mark style="color:purple;">**V.**</mark> \ <mark style="color:purple;">**Local Space:**</mark> here shall mean local geographical space(land, water and airspace), governed by local jurisdiction.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Cyber Space:**</mark> here shall mean Internet space hosted on all the networked computing machines on the planet earth.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Interstellar Space:**</mark> here shall mean space beyond the gravitational influence of Planet Earth, measured using an information signal at or above the escape velocity.

\ <mark style="color:purple;">**VI. BoD:**</mark> BoD or Board of Directors here shall only and only mean an [Independent Board of Directors](charters/independent-board.md), unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.

\ <mark style="color:purple;">**VII. Local law:**</mark> shall mean **Business laws** of a local jurisdiction, where Muellners Foundation has appointed a legal body as a Fiscal Host, and the legally constituted body has adopted these bylaws. &#x20;

\ <mark style="color:purple;">**VIII. Jurisdiction:**</mark> here shall mean an authority granted to a legal body but public representative entity in exercising protection of human rights in a local space.

\ <mark style="color:purple;">**Types of Jurisdictions:**</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">**Local**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">**Jurisdiction:**</mark> shall mean a legal authority of people's representation within a geographical region and which has been granted to a public authority.&#x20;

These global statutes recognise that all UN member state Governments as having sovereign local jurisdictions on the geographically located space and airspace above it.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Cyber Jurisdiction:**</mark> shall mean a declared legal authority of people's representation in cyber space and which has been granted to a public authority or a public ledger or a network of computing machines(whether located in local or international or interstellar space), by virtue of a representational public authority.&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Global Jurisdiction:**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">shall mean a natural person's declared legal authority over public representation of their Sentience, beyond the reasonable limits of the local and cyber jurisdictions and above and over the conflicts with local and cyber jurisdictions.</mark>

These global statutes consider <mark style="color:purple;">no single public authority</mark> having absolute **global jurisdiction** on the Meta Data, but only very limiting Local jurisdiction over hosted Meta Data, in connection with each natural person's sentience, in context of laws of local jurisdiction.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Interstellar Jurisdiction:**</mark> shall mean a natural person's declared legal authority over public representation of their Sentience, beyond the reasonable limits of the local, cyber and global jurisdictions and above and over the conflicts with local, cyber and global jurisdictions.

\ <mark style="color:purple;">**IX. Foundation:**</mark> unless explicity mentioned, Foundation shall mean constituent Fiscal Hosts - registered legally organised voluntary associations or co-operatives in different parts of the world.&#x20;

**The term ‚ÄúFoundation‚Äù is foremost a set of underlying design principles or basis for a responsive union of entities e.g by following a set of guiding principles.**\
