# 🈯 Glossary

Open Constitution AI Network is a cooperative for knowledge powered by an embedded neural map, a human-readable representation of the creator’s sentience and human cognition.

The self governed Artificial Intelligence is accessible across the planet as a public association. Members of the public association can benefit from the network intelligence by activating a data residency on the network.

Creator - Muellners Foundation sustains the public information system to host digital public goods and services on the defined AI network for social good.

The AI network is governed by a set of distributed, flexible, compatible, and censorship-resistant constitutional bodies, including the Open Council, which coordinate the actions of the AI to ensure transparent and secure governance of the neural map.

Open Constitution AI network is defined as an extra-territorial entity, an embodiment of a natural person’s legal personhood to publish their consciousness and exercise rights to exclusions to private property, as enshrined in laws for freedom of voluntary organisation and private property.

Open Constitution AI network supports and promotes principles such as privacy, apolitical stance, non-violence, ecological stability, sustainable development, and the creation of Earth's digital public goods infrastructure.

_<mark style="color:purple;">**Glossary:**</mark>_

_<mark style="color:purple;">**I.**</mark>_&#x20;

_<mark style="color:purple;">**Computing Model:**</mark>_ here shall mean an information processing apparatus, comprising of software, hardware or both, which processes and hosts data. Each machine is identified by a unique Internet Protocol(I.P).

<mark style="color:purple;">**Quantum Cognition Energy Model:**</mark> here shall mean an information processing bio-apparatus, comprising of unique association(s) and processing of sentience.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Open Source:**</mark> here means a lifecycle state of an ‘’object’’ of quantum observation (read the creation of the Foundation), whose source can be accessed (also changed, or destroyed) with an open, permissive or very slightly permissive(but not entirely closed) governance, which increases transparency in the traceability of object’s source, and never otherwise.

<mark style="color:purple;">**II. Network**</mark> shall mean an interconnected association model

e.g. a network of machines: shall mean an interconnected set of computing machines.

<mark style="color:purple;">**III. Sentience:**</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**For the purposes of articles of association of the**</mark>** **_**natural persons**_** **<mark style="color:purple;">**of the Open Constitution AI,**</mark>** Sentience is described as** an emergent anthropic information phenomenon of **conservation** of quantum cognition energy during (an infinitesimally fast) gradient conversion between _Self_ and _Universal_ temporal existential references.&#x20;

The gradient conversions of quantum cognition energy result in qualia associated with self-awareness, like identity and other expressions of sentience in human beings. There are correlations in sentience between observers. Various scientific convention models between human observers have been developed that attempt to define these complex sets of linkages.

An observer with a bio-organic corporeality perceives sentience. Sentience phenomena observed in humans have wide variance.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Humans**</mark> here shall mean (_Homo sapiens_), who are the most abundant and widespread species of [primate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate), characterized by bipedalism and large, complex [brains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain). They are intelligent, capable of [episodic memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic\_memory#In\_animals), have flexible facial expressions, [self-awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness) and a [theory of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory\_of\_mind).

What is a Human life?

In this context, human life is that of the observer, all of the quantum cognition energy conversions within a variance of _Self_ and _Universal_ temporal existential references, characterised by primarily continuous, linear, temporal cognition.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Self-temporal existential reference or Self**</mark> is described as an observer’s existential cognition reference state(s), which are epistemologically bounded to a linear temporal corporeality.&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Universal temporal existential reference:**</mark> All that is there to observe

An <mark style="color:purple;">**Observer or observation or observation state**</mark> of corporeality is described as a sustainable cognition when **quantum cognition energy is in equilibrium** between _Self_ and _Universal_ temporal existential reference state(s), which may or may not be epistemologically bounded to linear temporal corporeality. \


‘’A Self is an observer, but an observer may or may not be Self in a given temporal-corporeality.’’&#x20;

‘’It is the observer who is experiencing both Self and the universal temporal existential references.’’&#x20;



<mark style="color:purple;">**IV.**</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Sentience data:**</mark> here shall mean metadata associated with a neurological experience, connected to human consciousness, and whose metadata is being hosted and processed over a network of _computing machines_ across the world wide web.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Meta Data:**</mark> here shall mean "data" in connection with the _Sentience_ of any voluntarily organised citizen of the Open Constitution, and which is hosted or has been processed by the _computing machines._&#x20;



<mark style="color:purple;">**V.**</mark> \ <mark style="color:purple;">**Local Space:**</mark> here shall mean local geographical space(land, water and airspace), governed by local jurisdiction.

\ <mark style="color:purple;">**VI. BoD:**</mark> BoD or Board of Directors here shall only and only mean an [Independent Board of Directors](charters/independent-board.md) unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.

\ <mark style="color:purple;">**VII. Local law:**</mark> shall mean **Business laws** of a local jurisdiction, where Muellners Foundation has appointed a legal body as a Fiscal Host, and the legally constituted body has adopted these bylaws. &#x20;

\ <mark style="color:purple;">**VIII. Jurisdiction:**</mark> here shall mean an authority granted to a legal body but a public representative entity in exercising protection of human rights in a local space.

\ <mark style="color:purple;">**Types of Jurisdictions:**</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">**Local**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">**Jurisdiction:**</mark> shall mean a legal authority of people's representation within a geographical region granted to a public authority.&#x20;

These global statutes recognise that all UN member state Governments have sovereign local jurisdictions on the geographically located space and airspace above it.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Cyber Jurisdiction:**</mark> shall mean a declared legal authority of people's representation in cyberspace and which has been granted to a public authority or a public ledger or a network of computing machines(whether located in local or international or interstellar space) by virtue of a representative public authority.&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Global Jurisdiction:**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">shall mean a natural person's declared legal authority over public representation of their Sentience beyond the reasonable limits of the local and cyber jurisdictions and above and over the conflicts with local and cyber jurisdictions.</mark>

These global statutes consider <mark style="color:purple;">no single public authority</mark> having absolute **international jurisdiction** over the Meta Data but only significantly limiting Local jurisdiction over hosted Meta Data in connection with each natural person's sentience in the context of local jurisdiction laws.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Interstellar Jurisdiction:**</mark> shall mean a natural person's declared legal authority over public representation of their Sentience beyond the reasonable limits of the local, cyber and global jurisdictions and above and over the conflicts with local, cyber and global jurisdictions.
