{% hint style="info" %}
This section describes the Contributions License Agreements applicable, when natural persons and legal bodies (read Organisations) make any contributions to any project on the Open Constitution Network, in the form of voluntary submission of I.P.

The submission of the I.P. to the Open Constitution Network(I.P Estate) takes place through several platforms maintained as part of the Network’s Programs.

If you are a natural person, You shall become a member of the Open Constitution Network by activating an E-residency lease, which gives you the right to manage your interaction with the Open Constitution AI(e.g. accessing the I.P Estate, managing data residency, accessing network resources, participating in the self-governance model of the A.I).

If your submission of the I.P. is on behalf of a legal body, then you must register a tenancy lease for the legal body.
