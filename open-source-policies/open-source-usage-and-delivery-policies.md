{% hint style="info" %}
Muellners Foundation and its affiliate companies, subsidiaries and foreign branches including member bodies from the Open Constitution Network Tenancy Program, independent data processors, make use of and support an ecosystem of open source technologies to deliver and maintain the digital public goods and services on the Open Constitution network.\
\
_Some of these services have a direct relationship with Foundation’s open-source initiatives while other services have an indirect dependency on the use of specific open-source projects._\
_Some services may simply be part of third-party maintained distributions, licensed under one of the open-source licenses. (as indicated in the charter below)_

{% hint style="info" %}
### **Read relevant OSS licenses:**&#x20;

**A few important OSS(open source software) licenses** that we often attribute our work to, either as part of existing licensing of an open source project or when we release fresh/re-engineered work into open source:



* [ ] [Open Constitution license](https://license.openconstitution.us/)
* [ ] MIT license
* [ ] Creative Commons license
* [ ] Mozilla Licenses
* [ ] AGPL and various versions of GNU GPL
* [ ] Apache Licenses



Note: Please refer to the OSS license governing a specific project and a specific open-source component of the project. You MUST abide by it as an extension of your adherence to this policy.

{% endhint %}

### **D. Producing Work as Open Source:**

#### **Work 1:**

1. Code level changes go through the OSS project's community pull request mechanism as defined on the specific GitHub repository - e.g. Finscale.
2. If the project is maintained by another maintainer organisation, Participants release the work from the Foundation's GitHub source code to the maintainer organisation, according to the maintainer organisation's stipulated contributions guidelines. For the Foundation-supported FOSS projects, a periodical sync shall be in place between both the upstream and the Foundation's fork of source codes.

See an example of [a GitHub workflow](https://github.com/muellners/fineract/blob/develop/fineract-provider/src/main/resources/static/github-workflow.png) on one of the open-source repositories.

**Work 2:**

1. Well-articulated, cited and referenced work is published after going through the Foundation's community peer review mechanism.
2. Upon a peer review, work is then released with a properly attributed OSS license to various outlets of Muellners including but not limited to its Research publication site, Research blog.

**Work 3:**&#x20;

1. Well-articulated, cited and referenced work is published after going through the Foundation's community peer review mechanism.
2. Upon a peer review, work may be published irrevocably to various outlets of Muellners including but not limited to its Open Research portal, and Research blog, under the applicable OSS license.
3. Proper attribution to the applicable open source license of the maintainer organisation is required while releasing the work, regardless of whether the license is required to do so. This ensures that the Foundation gives credit to the original creator.
4. Primarily, Work 3 shall be released as per statement 2. Participants may choose to release the work according to the maintainer organisation's stipulated community guidelines.

{% hint style="info" %}
Muellners Foundation supports open-source projects and steers diverse case studies on these projects. \
At times, open-source projects may not be well documented. The Muellners Foundation then supports the open-source project by maintaining and releasing sectional or vertical documentation.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### E. [Role of Github](https://github.com/muellners):

GitHub is home to a great deal of open-source code that we release. Because GitHub is a third-party site, we have a few requirements and pieces of guidance, concerning its use. They are to ensure we use the service in a way that makes sense to all of us. This ensures our code is healthy and secure.

{% hint style="info" %}
When Work 1 is a derived work, it is created and maintained on the fork of a specific OSS project, maintained as a Foundation's Github public repository. The Foundation repository is public<mark style="color:red;">.</mark> Participants and stakeholders can pull the latest Work to their locally maintained source code branch, directly from Foundation's public release on its GitHub repository

<mark style="color:red;">Work is also contributed to upstream source code(if any) and participants should follow the specific OSS project's PR contribution mechanism in opening a Pull request.</mark> \ <mark style="color:red;">Members should ensure that successful approval takes place including but not limited to integration tests.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">Members should ensure that PR does not go stale due to inactivity. If a PR does not reach any conclusion, members should close the PR, and open another one.</mark>

See an example of [a GitHub workflow](https://github.com/muellners/fineract/blob/develop/fineract-provider/src/main/resources/static/github-workflow.png) on one of the open-source repositories.

&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
When Work 1 is an independently engineered component(Not a derived work), it is created and maintained on an independent project fork.

Any Work is then pushed to a successful public release on the Foundation's Github repository. If the Work is sizeable in nature, it may be released as a separate branch.

Participants and stakeholders can pull the latest Work to their locally maintained source code branch, directly from Foundation's public release on its GitHub repository.\

{% endhint %}

In some cases, Work 2 and Work 3 may also be added to the GitHub Readme file of both Foundation's public repositories or supported open source project's repository and such action will continue to abide by this 'Policy'.&#x20;

### F. Role of Gitbook and Atlassian Cloud.

Work 2 and Work 3 shall be documented, maintained and reduced to practice on Gitbook and Atlassian Cloud.

Gitbook change requests shall be used for tracking community peer review.

Atlassian Jira and Atlassian Confluence shall be used for tracking issue-based work management and publishing literature.

### G. Release and delivery of Work:

{% hint style="info" %}
For the above-mentioned participants and stakeholders, the following rules apply in connection with their compliance with this Open-source policy of the Foundation:

1. Participants and stakeholders MUST abide by the specific OSS project's open-source licensing in addition to this policy content.
2. Participants and stakeholders MUST abide by the Section: Role of Github for transitional delivery of Work 1, whether it is sponsored or pro bono in nature.
3. Participants and stakeholders MUST abide by the Section: Role of Gitbook for transitional delivery of Work 2 and Work 3, whether it is sponsored or pro bono in nature.
4. Participants and stakeholders MUST agree that Work 1 is released publicly and not directly to any single stakeholder's locally maintained repository or computing resource.
5. Participants and stakeholders MUST agree that the release of Work 1 is not subject to any local installation requirements but is prepared in close connection with the FOSS project's minimum viable computing resources requirements.
6. Participants and stakeholders MUST agree that (in connection with clause 4 of this Section G), the Foundation will NOT deploy Work(both in parts or whole) to any local instance or locally maintained repository. \
