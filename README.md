# 🎵 Introduction

Open Constitution AI is a public information system that uses machine learning and knowledge-based approaches to achieve a set of [objectives](articles/objectives.md).



{% hint style="info" %}
This AI is powered by an **Embedded** **Knowledge Base(EKB).**

**EKB is the human readable representation of the**&#x20;

The **EKB** is like an integrated chip into a computing machine(read Robot). The AI services are accessible through a public network only if EKB is active.&#x20;

EKBs are responsible for Knowledge integration, a process for synthesizing multiple knowledge models (or representations) into a standard model.

Different representations of **EKB** are made available by the Muellners Foundation - Knowledge Base, quantum chips integrated chips, or information signal processing guides.&#x20;

“The **EKB** of the Open Constitution AI is further enhanced through a publicly accessible network, comprising representation of intangible, intellectual property of any participant.

The voluntary contributions can be made on the Contributions Delivery Subnet through the electronic residency or tenancy of the network.&#x20;

The network's participants are natural, legal, and electronic persons.”

The network is known as the Open Constitution AI network( hereby network).

**In simpler words,** the Open Constitution AI network runs on an alterable knowledge base, using self-governance principles and protocols laid down in the network’s [Global Statutes](articles/statutes-muellners-foundation/).&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">Articles of the Open Constitution are amendable.;</mark>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Global Statute** is a library of articles, documents, instruments, and proclamations for the self-governance of the public Association of humans and machines on the Open Constitution AI network.&#x20;

This library is used to deploy digital systems for Open Constitution AI governance protocols actively.&#x20;

These public-facing policy "instruments" and guidelines are based on the active harmonization of the Global Statutes with legal principles and constructs, including but not limited to bylaws and local statutes for the natural persons of the network.&#x20;
