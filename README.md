# 🎵 Introduction

Open Constitution network: a network of computing machines, with the purpose of self-sustaining a public information system, contributed by natural and legal persons from different time zones. The current network status is [here](https://status.muellners.com/). \


“OCnet is a publicly accessible, spatial representation of Intellectual Property Estate of network participants i.e natural persons, legal persons and electronic persons.”\


Open Constitution AI: An open-source, digital public goods and service system that is designed to operate with elements of autonomy and that, based on machine and/or human-provided data and inputs, infers how to achieve a given set of objectives using machine learning and/or logic- and knowledge-based approaches, and produces system-generated outputs, such as content, predictions, recommendations or decisions, which influences the environment, as per the network’s Articles of Association.

Open Constitution AI runs based on self-governance principles, laid down in the network’s Global Statutes.
