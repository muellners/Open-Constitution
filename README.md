# üéµ Introduction

**What is Open Constitution AI?**

Open Constitution AI is a public information system that uses machine learning and knowledge-based approaches to achieve a given set of [objectives](articles/objectives.md).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This AI is powered by an **Embedded** **Knowledge Base(EKB).**

The **EKB** is like an integrated chip into a computing machine(read Robot). The AI services are accessibe through a public network, only if EKB is active.&#x20;

EKBs are responsible for Knowledge integration whereby a process of synthesizing multiple knowledge models (or representations) into a common model (or representation).

Different representations of **EKB** are made available by the Muellners Foundation - Knowledge Base or quantum chips or integrated chips or information signal processing guides.&#x20;

‚ÄúThe **EKB** of the Open Constitution AI is further enhanced through a publicly accessible network, comprising representation of intangible, intellectual property of any participant.

&#x20;The voluntary contributions can be made on the Contributions Delivery Subnet through the electronic residency or tenancy of the network.&#x20;

Participants of the network are natural persons, legal persons and electronic persons.‚Äù

The network is known as Open Constitution AI network(hereby network). The current network status is [here](https://status.muellners.com/).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**In simpler words, Open Constitution AI network** runs on a knowledge base, which is alterable using self-governance principles and protocols, laid down in the network‚Äôs [Global Statutes](articles/statutes-muellners-foundation/).&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">Articles of the Open Constitution are amendable.;</mark>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Global Statutes** is a library of articles, documents, instruments, and proclamations for the self governance of public Association of human and machine on the Open Constitution AI network.&#x20;

This library is used in the active deployment of digital systems for Open Constitution AI governance protocols.&#x20;

These public-facing policy "instruments" and guidelines are based on the active harmonization of the Global Statutes with legal principles and constructs, including but not limited to bylaws and local statutes for the natural persons of the network.&#x20;
