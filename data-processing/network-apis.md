# üéûÔ∏è Network APIs

Several digital public goods and services on the Open Constitution Network are also available as public APIs for developers and members to embed these services into their use cases, in any use cases which they are building.

An API (Application Programming Interface) is simply some piece of machine code(software) that sends information back and forth between a website or app and a user. It is like an access point to an app that can access a database behind the app or service.
