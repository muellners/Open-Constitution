# üõ†Ô∏è Third Party AI Tools

On the Open Constitution network, AI tools and services from third party organizations may be put to use. This page also describes provisioning of external or third party AI tools, services and template models on the Contributions Delivery Subnet of the Open Constitution network.

This policy governs the usage guidelines.

AI tools and services such as template models may be activated as part of digital public goods and services hosted on the Open Constitution network.

**A. Usage of external or third party AI tools** and any fine-tuning of their models as a result of the use case on the Contributions Delivery Subnet of the Open Constitution network.

In consistency with network's data integrity policy and cloud security policy, the network ensures that the AI service/tool subscription does not use the Foundation data(collectively ''ours'', ''Associations'' or Co-operative where Foundation is as described in the Global Statutes and includes one or more constituent legal bodies) to finetune the embedded model or training the model i.e for service improvements.
