# ðŸŒŽ Notice: Emeritus Citizen

### REQUESTING DELETION OF SLACK MEMBER PROFILES:

**What does** [**profile deletion**](https://slack.com/help/articles/360000360443-Delete-profile-information-from-Slack) **mean?**

* Slack will delete personal identifiable information from the associated member's profile, such as their name and email address.
* Content (messages, posts or files) submitted by this member will not be deleted but will display under @deactivateduser.
* Deleting profile information is **permanent**. Once deleted, we're unable to retrieve the member's personal information or rebuild their account.

**Is there anything else we should know?**

* The requester's identity should be verified including the legitimacy of their request, or whether it requires deletion. This is up to Foundation to determine as the data controller of the workspace.
* More information about how Slack helps Customers meet their compliance obligations can be found [here](https://slack.com/trust/compliance).
