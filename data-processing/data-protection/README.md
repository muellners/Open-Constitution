## Data Management: transparency and control

We are an open engineering based global community. Transparency to the processing and control of our member space data is paramount to us.&#x20;

**Beyond the following actions of voluntary members of the subscribed membership activity of the Foundation, this policy lays down the fundamental principles of safe processing and control of member's data:**

a. Moderation of member messages on Foundation's public forums

b. Privacy Controls and triggers on Member's space such as 2 Factor login authentications, Invite only subscription, Actions on Inactive Member Profiles etc. &#x20;
