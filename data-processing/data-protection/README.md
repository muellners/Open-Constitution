## Data Management: Transparency and control

We are an open engineering-based global community. Transparency in the processing and control of our member space data is paramount to us.&#x20;

**Beyond the following actions of voluntary members of the subscribed membership activity of the Foundation, this policy lays down the fundamental principles of safe processing and control of member's data:**

a. Moderation of member messages on the Foundation's public forums

b. Privacy Controls and triggers on Member's space such as 2 Factor login authentications, Invite Only subscription, Actions on Inactive Member Profiles etc. &#x20;
