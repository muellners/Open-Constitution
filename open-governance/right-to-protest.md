# ðŸ™‹â™€ Right to Protest

Foundation's Open Constitution provides grounds for a fundamental _**"Right to Protest".**_&#x20;

With Foundation's open constitution and global steering, at times members may find each other at odds.&#x20;

A group of member(s) may feel that their community proposal did not receive sufficient representation.&#x20;

Member(s) may feel that they did not receive sufficient representation from the electorally appointed council or Project CWC members.&#x20;

"Each member has a say in each of the affairs of the Foundation."
