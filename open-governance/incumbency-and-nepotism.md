# ðŸ‘¿ Incumbency and Nepotism

Any Open Council membership shall be for a finite period of time to avoid bringing incumbency to the Foundation's self governance.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">Whenever any member retires from one Council body, any nomination to a different Open Council membership shall have a cooling period of atleast 3 months.</mark>
{% endhint %}

Foundation and its members do not support nepotism.

Any Foundation member shall not promote their related family members to the electoral seats. Therefore members shall take extra precautions in nominating proposals or candidatures to Open Council & its memberships.
