**About Self Promotion:**

<mark style="color:green;">"Self" promotion and "Self" nominations are not appealing within the governance framework of the Foundation.</mark>&#x20;

_Foundation members have organised themselves for the greater good of humankind, its sustainable future and world peace._&#x20;

It is therefore imperative that members also observe these characteristics, when inviting a new member to the "Invite only" Foundation community.

Whenever in doubt regarding a decision making exercise, a peer review shall be the taken as a preferred choice of decision making. \
