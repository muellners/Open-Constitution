{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:green;">This is the Foundation's Incubation Program known as Grow Program. Each year, Foundation selects different startup projects. Foundation's community supports these startup projects, incubate them and help these social sustainable projects and social entrepreneurs grow and thrive in Foundation's global ecosystem.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;"></mark>\ <mark style="color:green;">Foundation does not take any equity in return of providing incubation to for profit startups. Foundation requires Founders to pledge their technology into open source.</mark>&#x20;

## "No Equity Only Pledge to Open Source" Grow Program

The most important pledge that the Founders make before they join the Muellners Foundation's Grow program is that they pledge all the Intellectual Property generated during the incubation program, into open source.
