# 📔 Governance Protocols

Open Constitution network is a self-governing human-machine governance protocol using a decentralised and autonomous governance model.

Open Constitution uses a collection of distributed, flexible, compatible and censorship-resistant open-source tools and technology.&#x20;

Open Constitution initiative maintains a digital public goods and services infrastructure, endowed through digital grants and accrual open source licenses from major technology companies on planet Earth.

### **Statement on delegation of decision-making to the community.**

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:green;">We must create a participative and socially inclusive community, which runs itself in a decentralised auto-governed state.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Foundation's community is a global think tank, which pursues open research for the betterment of humanity.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Members focus on the core of solving the challenges to humanity, with their contributions.</mark>\ <mark style="color:green;">The decision-making and community governance over change requests are solely vested in this Open Constitution, this is in the hands of each human member.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">Therefore, the members must delegate management of decision Governance into a technology system, which is less and less centralised.</mark>

_**Open Constitution members organise themselves in a lateral structure.**_
{% endhint %}

Any member of the Open Constitution is eligible to be nominated to the [Open Council](../../foundation/committees-and-their-roles/).\
Council memberships are voluntary and pro bono.&#x20;

Council memberships are also term-based to allow for a flexible change of leadership.

Besides Open Council memberships, each project has a [CWC](../../foundation/core-working-committee/), a core Workgroup that exists to ensure the maintenance of projects & initiatives of the Open Constitution.

The subscribed membership activity is governed by a democratically elected [Executive Council](../../foundation/executive-council.md), administrative resolutions of which are vested in the Open Council, and maintained in effect by a judiciary system in the form of an [Open Tribunal](../../foundation/open-tribunal.md).

The electoral process for all these constitutional bodies is maintained by the [Election Council](../../foundation/election-council.md)
