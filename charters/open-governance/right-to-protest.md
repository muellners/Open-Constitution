# ðŸ™‹â™€ ðŸ™‹â™€ Protest Protocol

Open Constitution provides grounds for a fundamental _**"Right to Protest".**_&#x20;

A group of member(s) may feel that their community proposal did not receive sufficient representation.&#x20;

Member(s) may feel that they did not receive enough representation from the electorally appointed council or Project CWC members.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">**To activate "Right to Protest", the eligible conditions are:**</mark>

1. <mark style="color:purple;">Member has floated a community proposal.</mark> &#x20;
2. <mark style="color:purple;">The community proposal was subscribed by the</mark> [<mark style="color:purple;">Project CWC</mark>](../../foundation/core-working-committee/project-cwcs.md)<mark style="color:purple;">.</mark>
3. &#x20;<mark style="color:purple;">Community Proposal was subsequently rejected by the Project CWC and adequate reasons were supplied on rejection of the proposal.</mark>
4. <mark style="color:purple;">Community Proposal is "Inactive" and associated change request is currently at "Rejected" state.</mark>\
   \ <mark style="color:purple;">If the members feels that their community proposal did not receive a representation and then a member can activate "Right to Protest".</mark>
5. <mark style="color:purple;">For a "Right to Protest" to qualify for logging on Open Constitution Public Ledger, the change request should not be "Expired". Member(s) explicitly waive the "Right to protest" once the state of change request turns "Expired".</mark>&#x20;
6. <mark style="color:purple;">To activate "Protest", atleast two members are required to cosign a protest.</mark>
{% endhint %}

"Right to Protest" is a community consensus protocol and is necessarily logged on Open Constitution governance system.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:red;">Once a "</mark><mark style="color:red;">**Protest**</mark><mark style="color:red;">" is activated by member(s), project CWC chair supplies their remarks to the community in a public facing records, within 14 days of activation.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">During the "Protest",</mark> [<mark style="color:red;">**Stay Motion**</mark>](stay-motion.md) <mark style="color:red;">may or may not be applied to the Project.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">If the protesting member(s) do not find merits in the unanimous decision of the Steering</mark> [<mark style="color:green;">Committee Vote</mark>](../open-ballot/committee-vote.md)<mark style="color:green;">, member(s) may then take the subject to the Observation Council's Appeals mechanism.</mark>
