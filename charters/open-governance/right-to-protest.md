# 🙋♀ Protest Right

Open Constitution provides grounds for a fundamental _**"Right to Protest".**_&#x20;

A group of member(s) may feel that their community proposal did not receive sufficient representation.&#x20;

Member(s) may feel that they did not receive enough representation from the electorally appointed council or Project CWC members.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">**To activate "Right to Protest", the eligible conditions are:**</mark>

1. <mark style="color:purple;">Member has floated a community proposal.</mark> &#x20;
2. <mark style="color:purple;">The community proposal was subscribed to by the</mark> [<mark style="color:purple;">Project CWC</mark>](../../foundation/core-working-committee/project-cwcs.md)<mark style="color:purple;">.</mark>
3. &#x20;<mark style="color:purple;">The community Proposal was subsequently rejected by the Project CWC and adequate reasons were supplied for the rejection of the proposal.</mark>
4. <mark style="color:purple;">The community Proposal is "Inactive" and the associated change request is currently in a "Rejected" state.</mark>\
   \ <mark style="color:purple;">If the members feel that their community proposal did not receive a representation then a member can activate the "Right to Protest".</mark>
5. <mark style="color:purple;">For a "Right to Protest" to qualify for logging on Open Constitution Public Ledger, the change request should not be "Expired". Member(s) explicitly waive the "Right to protest" once the state of change request turns "Expired".</mark>&#x20;
6. <mark style="color:purple;">To activate "Protest", at least two members are required to cosign a protest.</mark>
{% endhint %}

"Right to Protest" is a community consensus protocol and is necessarily logged on the Open Constitution governance system.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:red;">Once a "</mark><mark style="color:red;">**Protest**</mark><mark style="color:red;">" is activated by a member(s), the project CWC chair supplies their remarks to the community in public-facing records, within 14 days of activation.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">The Steering Council then signs the "Protest" ticket and decides on the issue with a unanimous</mark> [<mark style="color:red;">Committee Vote</mark>](../open-ballot/committee-vote.md)<mark style="color:red;">.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">During the "Protest",</mark> [<mark style="color:red;">**Stay Motion**</mark>](stay-motion.md) <mark style="color:red;">may or may not be applied to the Project.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">If the protesting member(s) do not find merits in the unanimous decision of the Steering</mark> [<mark style="color:green;">Committee Vote</mark>](../open-ballot/committee-vote.md)<mark style="color:green;">, member(s) may then take the subject to the Observation Council's Appeals mechanism.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">Observation Council then signs the "Protest" ticket and decides on the issue with an Observation Council Vote.</mark>
{% endhint %}

This community consensus protocol is designed to activate a member or a group of member(s) "Right to Protest" on a project's steering decision.

{% hint style="info" %}
_The community is built on citizen goodwill. Only initiate "Right to Protest" in extreme circumstances._
