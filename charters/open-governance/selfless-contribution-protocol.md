# ðŸ’¡ Selfless Contribution

The Foundation's community establishes a governance equilibrium with a Selfless contribution protocol.

Selfless contribution is a community consensus protocol.

> Selfless: For anonymised contributions clarifications on a project or a program.

Open Governance decisions influence or continue to influence the Foundation's roadmap, direction and active steering.

_Selfless contribution_ consensus is applied to a project motion, for a designated period of time.
