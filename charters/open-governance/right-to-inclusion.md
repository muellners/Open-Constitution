# ðŸ—£ Inclusion Right

Open Constitution provides grounds for a fundamental _**"Right to Inclusion".**_&#x20;

At times members may find each other at odds. A member may feel that their community proposal did not receive enough attention from the collective intelligence.&#x20;

"Each member has a right to be included in the decision making of the Open Constitution initiatives."
