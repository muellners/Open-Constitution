# ðŸŽ† Chaos Motion

The Open Constitution network community establishes a governance equilibrium with a deterministic Chaos consensus protocol.

Chaos Consensus Motion is a community consensus protocol.

> Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.

Open Governance decisions influence or continue to influence the Foundation's roadmap, direction and active steering.

For _Deterministic Chaos_ consensus, eligible conditions are that the chaos motion is applied to resolutions, whereby if a governance resolution is sensitive to its initial conditions, topologically transitive, and has characteristics of non-periodicity.
