# 🤝 Peer Review Protocol

## Avoid Self Promotion, advocate ideas not people

> "Self" is described as the persona of a human being, associated with an existential basis of conscious experience of a human being, including but not limited to corporeality and non spatial cognition.
>
> Sustainable and non exploitative "Self" interests shall be asserted in the realm of Open Constitution's purpose of creating a better human society with technology based governance.&#x20;

**All forms of conscious experience of a human being shall be privacy protected and therefore at the discretion of each human member whether they share, discuss or publish information on their "Self".**

**About Self Promotion:**

<mark style="color:green;">"Self" promotion and "Self" nominations are not appealing within the governance framework of the Open Constitution.</mark>&#x20;
{% endhint %}

_Members have organised themselves for the greater good of humankind, its sustainable future and world peace._&#x20;

It is therefore imperative that members also observe these characteristics, when inviting a new member to the "Invite only"  communities of specific projects or programs of the Open Constitution.

**About Peer Review:**

Open Constitution initiatives are peer reviewed.

Whenever in doubt regarding a decision making exercise, a peer review shall be the taken as a preferred choice of decision making. \
