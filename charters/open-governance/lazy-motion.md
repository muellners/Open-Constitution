# ðŸ˜´ Lazy Consensus

The Open Constitution network's community establishes a governance equilibrium with a lazy consensus protocol.

Lazy Consensus Motion is a community consensus protocol.

> <mark style="color:blue;">**The action of governance (taken by an electorally appointed member) which keeps the community informed and is on lower ends of the Decision Pyramid can be registered with Lazy Consensus Protocol.**</mark>&#x20;

Open Governance decisions influence or continue to influence the Foundation's roadmap, direction and active steering.

For lazy consensus, a member simply informs the community's appropriate Open Decision Forum. The member applying lazy consensus shall attempt to best detail their community proposal, however, there is no clear guideline except for posting an associated change request.&#x20;

_It is therefore upon the active members of the community to respond or challenge a decision, registered with lazy consensus._&#x20;

_Lazy Consensus allows members to give their consent to a decision, generally indicating silence._

Decisions based on lazy consensus are eligible for a secondary review within the same electoral period.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Another member can challenge the motion (made using Lazy Consensus), with either a</mark> [<mark style="color:green;">Privilege Motion</mark>](privilege-motion.md) <mark style="color:green;">or</mark> [<mark style="color:green;">Stay Motion</mark>](stay-motion.md)<mark style="color:green;">.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">In theory, members can also exercise the</mark> [<mark style="color:green;">Right to Inclusion</mark>](right-to-inclusion.md) <mark style="color:green;">and the</mark> [<mark style="color:green;">Right to Protest</mark>](right-to-protest.md)<mark style="color:green;">, opposing decisions made with lazy consensus.</mark>

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">**Lazy Consensus is designed for low-key, and relatively easier open decisions.**</mark>&#x20;

_<mark style="color:purple;">Examples are common day-to-day activities of Core Working Committees, minor changes in a project's technical direction, and public repository periodic updates.</mark>_ <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">This is not an exhaustive list. Please refer to the</mark> [<mark style="color:purple;">**Decisioning Pyramid**</mark>](decisioning-pyramid.md)<mark style="color:purple;">**.**</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">All decisions taken through lazy consensus may also get quashed, only if an opposing citizen uses an appropriate consensus protocol and identifies the following:</mark>

1. <mark style="color:red;">That the decision was not eligible to be covered by lazy consensus and</mark>
2. <mark style="color:red;">That the subject of the decision qualifies on the upper ends of the Decision Pyramid.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">When a citizen or group of citizen(s) challenge a lazy consensus motion, members are not said to be in conflict. This event is not considered to be eligible for a Moderation policy unless conflicting members break the Code of Conduct.</mark>&#x20;

Members challenging a lazy consensus decision generally identify in their proposal:

1. &#x20;<mark style="color:red;">That there exists a better decision and</mark>&#x20;
2. <mark style="color:red;">That there is viability in retroactively taking this better decision now.</mark>
3. <mark style="color:red;">That the change request reversal does not affect the</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark>_<mark style="color:red;">Open</mark>_ <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">Trust ledger significantly.</mark>
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:green;">All Core Working Committee members, different Open Council body members, Ambassador Council members, or the Chancellor of the Executive Council can apply the Lazy Consensus motion.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">Lazy Consensus Motion should not be applied to decisions that require immediate processing or those requiring</mark> <mark style="color:red;">**emergency attention**</mark> <mark style="color:green;">i.e. proposals or change requests that received a</mark> [<mark style="color:green;">Privilege Motion</mark>](privilege-motion.md)<mark style="color:green;">.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Privilege Motion is generally applied by Council or Committee Chairs who have a strong reason to do so.</mark> \
\
<mark style="color:purple;">Decisions are logged on the Open Constitution Governance System, with the Lazy Consensus Motion Protocol.</mark>
