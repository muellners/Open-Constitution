**What is a Fiscal Host?**

A Fiscal host is a legal representative body, nominated by, and appointed by the Independent Board, Muellners Foundation, EEA based on the counsel of the [Executive Co<mark style="color:purple;">uncil</mark>](../foundation/executive-council.md) of the Open Council.\
\
Independent Boards constitutionally represent the Foundation in local jurisdictions, and support the maintenance of the constituent Fiscal body, in compliance with Local Law.
