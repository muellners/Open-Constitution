# ðŸ—³ Open Ballot

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:green;">**Open Ballot is the voting system embodied in our community's governance constitution.**</mark>
{% endhint %}

> "Each member has a say in each of the Foundation's acts."&#x20;

The way the members get to have their say is entirely vested in our universal suffrage with the exception that the members are distributed in project governing committees.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">a. Open Constitution Governance System is a technical management system that brings characteristics of decentralised autonomy to the network community.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">b. Open Ballot is the voting system, adopted in the Open Constitution Network.</mark>\
\
\
<mark style="color:red;">Note: Open Ballot is presently maintained with community proposals and Council resolutions on the Open Decision forums of the Foundation.</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;">All Vote-based decisions must be logged on the Foundation's public ledger.</mark>\
\
<mark style="color:green;">Members are also building consensus in the community for the open ballot in the Open Convention.</mark> \ <mark style="color:green;">Specific types of votes are generally moderated by either the Election Council or Executive or Steering Council members on whether the captured decisions have achieved a qualifying quorum, as per this Open Constitution.</mark>
{% endhint %}

**All members of the Foundation, including individual members affiliated with the Open Constitution Network Tenancy Program can participate in the Open ballot, freely, voluntarily and in confidence.**

1. Each community member has a single registered vote to decide on an issue, listed on the Open Ballot (read electoral system) of the Foundation. &#x20;
2. Quorum on a vote is always achieved when at least half of the members, organised according to the Ballot distributions below, participate in the vote.

{% hint style="info" %}
_<mark style="color:purple;">**How do we manage the Vote using a digital token?**</mark>_

_<mark style="color:purple;">Each vote is assigned a unique yet indivisible token on an Internet-based public ledger.</mark>_&#x20;

_<mark style="color:purple;">Token distribution and supply are variable and directly linked to votes.</mark>_ \
_<mark style="color:purple;">Votes are currently pegged at the Global Population of the planet Earth, (excluding human population below the age of 18).</mark>_&#x20;

_<mark style="color:purple;">Tokens are used for a member to participate and access Open Ballot.</mark>_&#x20;

_<mark style="color:purple;">The token holders are uniquely identified with a decentralised identity management system of the Foundation.</mark>_&#x20;

_<mark style="color:purple;">All unclaimed token supply rests on the public network until it is claimed</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">**in the future when the token owner gets naturalised as a citizen of the Foundation.**</mark>_

_<mark style="color:purple;">The value of the token is associated with the Foundation's Total Impact Fund's value.</mark>_

This creates an electoral matrix of token distribution for the community members, which the community tracks live and is publicly accessible on the Open Constitution Network Governance System.&#x20;
