# 📔 Open Council Vote

canAn Open "Council vote" currently takes place on the private mailing list, maintained by the local Independent Board. The private mailing list comprises local members of the Open Council.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a no-reply Mailing List.\
\
<mark style="color:red;">Public Message: Please do not send SPAM. SPAM gets neither posted on this mailing list. A System monitors and flags anything inappropriate.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">Open Council may take action to assert the Muellners Foundation's legal rights on any inappropriate SPAM sent to this mailing list.</mark>
{% endhint %}

_Any Open Council member may invoke a Council Vote._&#x20;

_An Independent Board member may also invoke an Open Council Vote._

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">There are many purposes for which a Council vote may take place. It can be a member nomination, a resolution on a community proposal for action by the Foundation, or simply a matter of ethical governance.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">Whatever the reason may be, a Council vote shall be organised when the subject matter has reached a state of visible consensus-building exercise in the Foundation's community. (within 72 hours)</mark>\ <mark style="color:purple;">Each decision arrived out of the Council vote shall be independently ratified by the Independent Board</mark>.
{% endhint %}

#### For Open Council members, it is important to note that

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:green;">**Electoral Process for any "Council Resolution" is conditional to a quorum.**</mark>&#x20;

\
<mark style="color:green;">**a.**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">Quorum is achieved when a minimum of half</mark> <mark style="color:green;">of all the Open Council members, participate in the Council Resolution - "Council Vote".</mark>\
<mark style="color:green;">**b.**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">A decision is received in favour of the Council Resolution - "Council Vote", when the majority of all the participating members of the Open Council, vote "+1".</mark>\
\ <mark style="color:green;">E.g.: Let's say there are 21 Open Council members.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">At least 11 members shall participate in the Council Resolution for the "Council Vote" to achieve a quorum. This is the qualifying state for the Council Resolution to be logged on the</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark>_<mark style="color:green;">Open Constitution</mark>_ <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">public ledger.</mark>\ <mark style="color:green;">For any Council Resolution to be electorally approved, the "Council Vote" should receive at least half of the total votes(required for quorum), in favour of any Council Resolution.</mark>\
\
_<mark style="color:green;">So, in this example, six (+1) votes of the participating 11 Council members will do the job.</mark>_<mark style="color:green;">😒</mark> &#x20;
{% endhint %}

Remember to note that the Muellners Foundation is a lateral organised association. \
This means that for any Council resolution to qualify for a vote, it shall be first proposed in the community as a **"Community Proposal"**.  &#x20;

1. &#x20;Each Council Vote is active for a specific amount of time - the minimum being 24 hours for subjects requiring urgent notice.&#x20;
2. For each Council resolution, the "Council Vote" is generally held for 72 hours, such that members from different time zones can respond to the Vote. \
   The period to cast a vote may also be extended in cases requiring attention and if two or more members request to do so.
3. Each Council Resolution is broadcast on the private mailing list of the Council.&#x20;

### How to Initiate a Vote?

_A member of a Council shall only invoke a Vote for a Council resolution._

After a proposal has been discussed in the Foundation's community, a Council member can post an email to the Open Council's mailing list.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:green;">**a.**</mark> <mark style="color:green;">`Subject: [VOTE] Title of the Vote`</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">**b. Body:**</mark>

_<mark style="color:green;">`I wish to nominate Pokemon for the annual gala of the Foundation. or I wish to nominate "Entity" for addition to the`</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">Open Constitution</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">`Partner Program. or I wish to nominate a Board Resolution for ............`</mark>_

_<mark style="color:green;">`(Please write a statement of why are you supporting the Council resolution or the background of initiating the resolution)`</mark>_

_<mark style="color:green;">`Voting guidelines:`</mark>_

_<mark style="color:green;">`+1 (for Yes, and please specify your comments)`</mark>_

_<mark style="color:green;">`-1 (for No , and please specify the reasons or alternate course of action)`</mark>_&#x20;

_<mark style="color:green;">`0 (if you have no comments & do not object)`</mark>_\


_<mark style="color:green;">`For recording a quorum qualifying reasons: No response or no reply to the Council vote is considered as a no participation. Members are encouraged to register 0 in case they wish to participate but have no comments and no objections.`</mark>_&#x20;

_<mark style="color:green;">`Vote is OPEN for: 72 hours`</mark>_

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">Note:</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">Supply enough documentation, supporting the contents of the Vote.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">Council members are able to cast an informed board vote based on the associated literature. Council members are subject matter experts in a relevant domain.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">Therefore, adding well-documented literature is ideal for Council member's review and a positive value that these members can provide back to their community.</mark>
