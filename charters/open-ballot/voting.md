# 🗳 Voting

#### Voting:

Voting on key change requests is a democratic process w.r.t Muellners Foundation's subscribed membership activity. Voting also takes place when members are arriving at a consensus on a community proposal, in Foundation's Open Decision forum.

The vote also takes place when nominations, appointments, removals to Open Council Committees or **Right to Protest** are initiated.

Other issues where Votes take place are <mark style="color:red;">**Impeachment of the Open Council Committee Presidents and Chancellors**</mark>**, **<mark style="color:purple;">**Community Referendums**</mark>, and the <mark style="color:green;">Vote of Confidence</mark>.
