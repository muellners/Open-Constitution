Article 2. It is the task of the board to

* Establish a special executive committee formulating the responsibilities of the chairperson

Article 3. The board shall be elected in such a way that two or more members are elected in turn at the annual general meeting for a period of two years.

Article 4. Minors cannot financially represent the association. Any natural person who is a member of the association who has reached the age of 18 is eligible for election as a board member. Any member of the association who has reached the age of 18 is eligible for election as chairperson and treasurer.



{% hint style="info" %}
Help Text: Although for several purposes such as accessing open learning platforms of the Open Constitution AI network for upskilling members, the eligible age for E Residents membership to a local Fiscal host is 15, these members cannot financially represent the association.
{% endhint %}

Article 5. Any natural person who is a member of the association and who has obtained an electoral certification from the Executive Council, Media Council, Legal, Regulations, Treasury, Steering, or Ethics Council of the Open Council is eligible for election as a board member of this association.

Any natural person who is a member of the association and who has obtained an electoral certification from the Treasury Council of the Open Council is eligible for election as a board member and to serve as a treasurer.

Natural persons must maintain their electoral appointments in the Open Council body during their complete tenure for serving on the association's board.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Help Text for Article 5:_

Upper House to receive electoral certification: Open Councilâ€™s Executive Council, Media Council, Legal, Regulations, Treasury, Steering, or Ethics Council

Lower House: Independent Board and its steward committee members of Fiscal Host Association.&#x20;

**Pre-requisite for electoral certification:** Open Council bodies act as a prover of the interests of the associationâ€™s (natural person) members, who wish to be elected to the Board of the Fiscal Host.

The natural persons must, therefore obtain an electoral certification from Open Council prior to seeking election to the board of the association and maintain the electoral certification, at all times, to remain as the member of the Association's Board.

Since, this association relies on intellectual property contributions made by the global citizens, electoral certification acts as a measure for certifying that the member to the board has received or gained Trust from the global consortium.

In simpler words, to be eligible for election to the Independent Board of the Fiscal Host, a member of this association must file a nomination in the AI network's governance system and secure an electoral appointment to the Open Council of the Open Constitution AI network. Only these members are therefore, qualified to be elected and serve on the Independent Board.

They must maintain this electoral appointment to the Open Council body throughout their tenure while serving on the Independent Board . This is described as electoral certification in the Open Constitution.

The Open Constitution AI network has characteristics of an extraterritorial regulatory technology standard, i.e., outside the purview of one single jurisdiction, since it hosts intellectual property and the creation of minds of human beings, whose conduct is affiliated with different jurisdictions on the planet.
{% endhint %}

Article 6. The chairperson and the treasurer are elected first, on priority, and separately so that the organisational chairperson can be elected for a two-year period.

Article 7. If a chairperson or treasurer voluntarily resigns untimely or involuntarily removed, the board shall appoint a new chairperson or treasurer to serve until the next annual general meeting. If the position is not to be elected that year, cf. Article 3, a chairperson shall be elected for a one-year period.

Article 8. If one or more board members resign early, a corresponding number of candidates shall be elected at the annual general meeting for a period of one year. The one-year mandate is awarded on the basis of the lowest number of personal votes.

Article 9. Alternates: The general meeting can elect up to two alternates for one-year terms. If a board member resigns, the alternates shall take office in the chosen order until the next annual general meeting. If a board member decides to take a leave of absence for a given period, an alternate will be appointed for the period in question.

Article 10. If there is no alternate elected by the general meeting, the board is self-sufficient until the next annual general meeting, where the vacancy on the board must be filled with a mandate from the general meeting.
