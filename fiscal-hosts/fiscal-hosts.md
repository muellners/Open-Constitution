<mark style="color:green;">The Executive Council, on behalf of the Open Council, appoints</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**Fiscal Hosts**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">in each member state of the UN as fiduciary bodies.</mark>



<mark style="color:green;">A fiscal Host is a legal fiduciary body of the extraterritorial Trust network in a local jurisdiction. The Foundation that runs the network is an extra territorial entity. Therefore, fiscal bodies constitute the Foundation, in accordance with Article II, IIIA, VIII, V A, VI A, XI A, XII.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">The initial members in the jurisdiction adopt the Fiscal Host AoAs, specific to each jurisdiction. These are listed</mark> [<mark style="color:green;">here</mark>](fiscal-host-aoa.md)<mark style="color:green;">.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">Muellners Foundation is the lessor entity that awards the right to use assets to each Fiscal Host for claiming the Trust Network's beneficiary licenses.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">Local Independent Boards in each Fiscal Host are constituted from these</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**Fiduciary bodies.**</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">Fiscal Hosts also maintain local membership and beneficiary citizen registry.</mark> \ <mark style="color:green;">Fiscal Hosts maintain the Foundation's compliance with local business laws, besides holding trust and funds on behalf of the Muellners Foundation.</mark>

Global Statutes prescribe Articles and instruments to Fiscal Hosts to fully address compliance of constituent legal bodies of this Public Association's activities in the local jurisdictions e.g. in the context of the Information Technology Acts, Cyber Security Laws, Legal Contract Binding Acts, Business Laws etc.

\
<mark style="color:blue;">Fiscal Host Legal Bodies and their members continue to independently work on the local advocacy of the Foundation's guiding principles.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Each Fiscal Host appoints an Independent Board, which also represents the local community of the Foundation.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">The local Independent Board members also appoint a third-party Data Protection Officer, an auditor and a chartered accountant in accordance with the Open Constitution, and based on local requirements of compliance with business laws.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">üíÅTreasury Council and other Open Council bodies are designed to screen Fiscal hosts, with independent and autonomous diligence where different artefacts are filed on the Open Constitution AI network Governance System by Steward Committee on behalf of fiscal hosts.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">Foundation also periodically reviews the Fiscal Hosts' local compliance through periodical (annual) audits.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">The Treasury and Regulatory Compliance audits are released to the general public, in the form of a quarterly "Transparency Report", regardless of whether local business laws require a fiscal audit or not.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">**The following members participate in the screening and dilligence:**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Fiscal Host's Steward Group, Legal CWC and Open Council bodies, namely Regulations, Legal and Treasury Council.</mark>
