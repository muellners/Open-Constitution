LEGAL IMPRINT:&#x20;

The Open Constitution Network is maintained under the legal stewardess of the below identified legal bodies, which have independent Legal persons status.&#x20;



{% hint style="info" %}
Open Constitution AI Network is maintained autonomously, i.e. without absolute control by a single natural person, using a novel legal and regulatory approach to the interlinkages between market and non-market services, using frameworks of international rule of law.

That is, commercial exchanges between humans for which regulated markets exist and those where the laws in principle have not yet been created. \
